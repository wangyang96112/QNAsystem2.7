0,What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?,manifestation,"Symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person, but people with diabetes should learn to recognise their own signs in order to treat the hypo as quickly as possible. Some of the most common symptoms of a hypo include: Feeling dizzy, Feeling hungry, A change in mood, Feeling sweaty, Trembling, Finding it hard to concentrate."
1,What is Diabetes?,informationanddefinition,"ost of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugars to build up in the blood. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. Diabetes is predicted by a clear set of symptoms, but it still often goes undiagnosed. The main 3 diabetes signs are: Increased thirst, Increased need to urinate, Increased hunger, Diabetes is becoming increasingly more common throughout the world, due to increased obesity - which can lead to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes leading to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes."
2,How many diabetics are there?,informationanddefinition,"According to the IDF, the number of diabetics in the world stands at 365 million people, representing around 8.5% of the global population. There are approximately 2.9 million diabetic people in the UK according to Diabetes UK, and there’s thought to be around 500,000 people who may be diabetic but currently undiagnosed."
3,How is diabetes controlled?,management,"Type 1 diabetes is controlled with insulin, either by regular injections of insulin or through wearing an insulin pump which drips insulin into the body through the day. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled through diet and exercise, , although it is common for people with type 2 diabetes to need medication such as tablets or injections to help them to keep their blood sugar levels within the normal range."
4,What are the two major types of diabetes?,informationanddefinition,"Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent) requires insulin to treat, is typically developed as a child or young adult, and is a disease that destroys pancreatic cells meaning no insulin production is possible. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent diabetes) is considerably more common and typically affects people over the age of 45, who are also overweight. Those suffering from type 2 are unable to produce enough insulin, and sugar builds up in the bloodstream."
5,how to diagnose Wolfram syndrome?,diagnosis,Wolfram syndrome will usually by diagnosed if the symptoms of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are present. Genetic testing can be used to confirm Wolfram syndrome.
6,How do you treat Wolfram syndrome?,management,"Treatment for Wolfram syndrome involves treating each of the individual symptoms. Diabetes insipidus: Controlled by taking the hormone vasopressin either by nasal spray, tablets or by injection. Diabetes mellitus: Controlled by taking insulin and regularly monitoring blood glucose levels, Optic atrophy: No treatment is available for optic atrophy, Deafness: Can be treated with a hearing aid, Muscle jerks: Can be controlled with anticonvulsant medication"
7,what are the causes of Wolfram syndrome?,cause,"Wolfram syndrome is caused by a mutation in the WFS1 gene. The WSF1 gene controls the production of a protein called wolframin which is thought to be involved in the regulation of calcium in many parts of the body. If you have a child with Wolfram syndrome, there is a 1 in 4 chance that each of your other children will develop Wolfram syndrome. It is possible to carry out genetic testing, whilst pregnant, to determine whether the developing baby will develop Wolfram’s syndrome."
8,What is Alström Syndrome?,informationanddefinition,Alström syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterised by a number of features notably including extreme sensitivity to light hearing problems heart problems obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most of the features of Alström syndrome are treatable although health complications of the condition are common. It is estimated that around 200 families in the UK may be affected by Alström syndrome.
9,What does Alström Syndrome Symptoms includes?,manifestation,There are a number of common features of Alström syndrome which include: Eye problems: Including retinal degeneration (progressive worsening of vision) nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and photophobia (extreme sensitivity to light) Hearing impairment Cardiomyopathy: Disorder of the heart muscle Obesity Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: Leading to type 2 diabetes Hypertriglyceridaemia: Abnormally high triglyceride levels in the blood Renal dysfunction: Kidney disorders Heart and eye problems will often be diagnosed shortly after birth whilst hearing problems usually occur before the age of 10. Children with Alström syndrome will usually gain weight quickly despite eating healthily and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes within childhood is common. The features which a child develops as well as the severity of the symptoms can vary from child to child. Additional complications which can follow include: Bladder and bowel problems Bone and joint problems: Including arthritis Hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Hypothyroidism: Underactive thyroid function.
10,what is the causes of Alström syndrome?,cause,Alström syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ALMS1 gene. A mutation in this gene is known to affect a protein related to cilia minute whiskers which are present on the surface of cells. If each parent has a mutation in the ALMS1 gene there is a 1 in 4 chance that each child they have will develop Alström syndrome.
11,How is Alström syndrome diagnosed?,diagnosis,A diagnosis of Alström syndrome may be made based on presence of the symptoms. If confirmation is needed genetic testing can be used to identify mutation of the ALMS1 gene.
12,Can I get an artificial pancreas?,informationanddefinition,There are three main artificial pancreas systems being worked on by researchers: Closed-loop artificial pancreas Bionic pancreas Implanted artificial pancreas.
