1,How many types of insulin are there?,informationanddefinition,"There are 4 types of insulin based on how soon the insulin starts working (onset) when it works the hardest (peak time) and how long it lasts in your body (duration). However each person responds to insulin in his or her own way.That is why onset peak time and duration are given as ranges. The types of insulin are: Rapid-acting insulin (Lispro) reaches the blood within 15 minutes after injection. It peaks 30 to 90 minutes later and may last as long as 5 hours. Short-acting (regular) insulin usually reaches the blood within 30 minutes after injection. It peaks 2 to 4 hours later and stays in the blood for about 4 to 8 hours. Intermediate acting (NPH and lente) insulins reach the blood 2 to 6 hours after injection. They peak 4 to 14 hours later and stay in the blood for about 14 to 20 hours. Long acting (ultralente) insulin takes 6 to 14 hours to start working. It has no peak or a very small peak 10 to 16 hours after injection. It stays in the blood between 20 and 24 hours.Some insulins come mixed together. For example you can buy regular and NPH insulins already mixed in one bottle. They make it easier to inject two kinds of insulin at the same time.However you can’t adjust the amount of one insulin without also changing how much you get of the other insulin.""",there are 4 types of insulin based on how soon the insulin starts working (onset) when it works the hardest (peak time) and how long it lasts in your body (duration).,['peak'],"['types', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'onset', 'time', 'body', 'duration']","['insulin', 'types', 'insulin', 'body', 'duration']",['many'],"['types', 'insulin']","['types', 'insulin']"
2,What determines the strengths of insulin?,informationanddefinition,"Insulins come dissolved in liquids at different strengths. Most people use U-100 insulin. This means it has 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of fluid. Be sure that the syringe you use matches the insulin strength. U-100 insulin needs a U-100 syringe. In Europe and Latin America U-40 insulin is also used. If you’re outside the United States be certain to match your insulin strength with the correct size syringe.""",insulins come dissolved in liquids at different strengths.,['different'],"['insulins', 'liquids', 'strengths']","['insulins', 'liquids', 'strengths']",[],"['strengths', 'insulin']","['strengths', 'insulin']"

4,How does alcohol affect Blood Sugar?,complications,"Alcohol can have a confusing effect on blood sugar levels because it prevents the liver from producing glucose. One consequence of this is that hypoglycemia can occur after a night of drinking. As a result people with diabetes are often advised to eat something to compensate for the expected drop in blood sugar levels. Alcohol does affect different people in different ways so if in doubt test your blood glucose to see how alcohol affects you. Some people may find it all too easy to let diabetes drift out of their mind when having alcohol and not worry too much about sugar levels. However it is advisable to test blood sugar levels whenever possible to get an idea of how different drinks affect your sugar levels.""",alcohol can have a confusing effect on blood sugar levels because it prevents the liver from producing glucose.,['confusing'],"['alcohol', 'effect', 'blood', 'sugar', 'levels', 'liver', 'glucose']","['alcohol', 'blood sugar levels', 'effect', 'glucose', 'liver']",[],"['alcohol', 'Blood', 'Sugar']","['alcohol', 'Blood Sugar']"

11,What is an Autoimmune Disease?,informationanddefinition,"Autoimmune disease refers to illness or disorder that occurs when healthy tissue (cells) get destroyed by the body’s own immune system. The term autoimmune disease is one that many people with diabetes - in particular those with type 1 diabetes - will have come across or be familiar with. In the case of type 1 diabetes the disease-fighting system mistakes healthy cells in the pancreas for foreign harmful invaders and attacks them leaving the body unable to produce its own insulin and keep levels of blood glucose under control. There are more than 80 different types of autoimmune disease from multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes to coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The immune system is the body’s protection against harmful substances such as bacteria viruses and toxins all of which contain harmful antigens. To counter this the immune system produces and sends antibodies (special proteins) to identify destroy these antigens. However in some cases the immune system cannot distinguish between healthy harmless tissue and antigens and as a result it attacks and destroys normal tissue (in people with diabetes the cells mistakenly targeted are the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas). This autoimmune reaction (or ‘attack’) is what triggers the development of an autoimmune disease.""",autoimmune disease refers to illness or disorder that occurs when healthy tissue (cells) get destroyed by the body’s own immune system.,"['autoimmune', 'healthy', 'own', 'immune']","['disease', 'illness', 'disorder', 'tissue', 'cells', 'body', 'system']","['illness', 'autoimmune disease', 'tissue', 'disorder', 'cells', 'body', 'immune system']",['Autoimmune'],['Disease'],['Autoimmune Disease']

Coeliac disease - autoimmune attack on substances found inside gluten damages the surface of the small bowel disrupting the body’s ability to take in essential nutrients from food. Graves’ disease - the small thyroid gland is attacked by the immune system leading to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Hashimoto’s disease - similar to Graves’ disease but this time damage to the thyroid gland lead to an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Multiple sclerosis - myelin sheaths which protect the nerve fibres carrying messages to and from the brain are targeted by the immune system causing behind scarring (known as sclerosis). Reactive arthritis - immune system is tricked into thinking a previous infection is still present and attacks healthy tissue causing it to become inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis - cells that line your joints are targeted by the autoimmune reaction causing joints and surrounding tissues to become swollen stiff and painful. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - immune system targets healthy tissue causing inflammation of the skin and joints and can affect internal organs.

17,What can cause binge eating to take place?,cause,"There are a number of psychological reasons which can trigger binge eating. The NHS state that around 50% of people that binge eat have had depression at some point in their life. Negative feelings including being stressed anxious sad helpless guilty or bored can cause people to eat as a conscious or unconscious way of momentarily blocking out the negative emotion. In some cases people may eat to amplify the negative feelings. Binge eating may also occur in people trying to lose weight through methods such as greatly restricted calorie content or missing meals which can lead to intense hunger and feeling a need to binge eat. It is common for binge eating to lead to other negative feelings such as guilt regret or further loss of control shortly after eating which can trigger a vicious circle of continued binge eating.""",there are a number of psychological reasons which can trigger binge eating.,['psychological'],"['number', 'reasons', 'binge', 'eating']","['reasons', 'number', 'binge eating']",[],"['binge', 'eating', 'place']","['binge eating', 'place']"
18,How can hunger follow after recently eating?,informationanddefinition,"It is not unusual to experience hunger soon after eating snacks or meals with particularly fast acting carbohydrate content. Typical examples of foods with quickly absorbed carbohydrate include: Sugary foods Potato based foods Refined carbohydrates such as white bread white pasta and white rice When we eat quickly absorbed sources of carbohydrate our blood glucose levels will initially rise rapidly and should trigger our pancreas to release insulin. This usually presents problems for people with diabetes. In type 2 diabetes the body doesn’t respond as well as it should to insulin and so it takes longer for the body to produce sufficient insulin to cope with the rise in blood sugar. People with type 1 diabetes will inject insulin to help the body cope with the increase in blood sugar levels but when we eat fast acting carbohydrate it can take more than 2 hours for enough insulin to be absorbed to adequately cope with the increase in blood glucose levels. When our blood sugar levels rise to high levels and we don’t have sufficient insulin in our blood to cope it can often cause us to feel both tired and hungry and can therefore make us crave more food which can lead to vicious circle forming. Another reason for feeling intense hunger after consuming too much quick acting carbohydrate is that once our insulin has caught up the insulin may bring our blood glucose levels too low which frequently triggers strong feelings of hunger.""",it is not unusual to experience hunger soon after eating snacks or meals with particularly fast acting carbohydrate content.,['unusual'],"['hunger', 'snacks', 'meals', 'carbohydrate', 'content']","['snacks', 'hunger', 'meals', 'carbohydrate content']",[],['hunger'],['hunger']

41,How are children with diabetes treated?,management,"After diagnosis a child will usually be referred to a regional diabetes specialist. Most children with diabetes are cared for by their hospital as opposed to their GP. Because type 1 typically means that the vast majority of islet cells have been destroyed and insufficient or zero insulin can be produced the only certain method of treating diabetes in children is insulin treatment. Usually a diabetes care team will plan an insulin regimen suited to individual requirements and habits of the child. Fast-acting insulin will generally be administered during the day and nocturnal levels will be controlled by a slow-acting dose. Insulin pumps are also common amongst children. Sometimes in the initial period following diagnosis small children will only need a very small dose of insulin but this will unfortunately change as they grow older and larger. Good glucose control is essential in the management of all diabetics’ conditions.Treating type 2 diabetes in children depends entirely on how far their condition has developed.

There are two major delivery sites above the abdomen and in the thigh but your healthcare team will elaborate. You should become familiar with the symptoms of low blood glucose and also diabetic ketoacidosis. As well as recognising these conditions you should know what to do if they occur. Monitor your child’s blood sugar levels and as soon as they are old enough teach them how to do this.

Determining the presence of LADA is achieved by examining the presence of elevated levels of pancreatic autoantibodies amongst patients who have recently been diagnosed with diabetes but do not require insulin. A GAD Antibody test can measure the presence of these autoantibodies. These antibodies can identify LADA and also can predict the rate of progression towards insulin dependency. Another test that can be performed is a C-peptide test. However C-peptide tests may not always draw conclusive results in people with LADA at an earlier stage of the condition’s development.""",often lada will be initially diagnosed as diabetes by way of the usual diagnosis procedures.,['usual'],"['diabetes', 'way', 'diagnosis', 'procedures']","['lada', 'diabetes', 'way', 'diagnosis procedures']",[],['LADA'],['LADA']
71,How is LADA treated?,management,"Because LADA develops slowly someone with LADA may be able to produce enough of their own insulin to keep sugar levels under control without needing insulin for a number of months or sometimes even years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes. Insulin will almost certainly be required at some point in the future. In some cases insulin therapy may be postponed. However there is evidence to suggest that starting insulin treatment soon after a diagnosis of LADA will help to better preserve the pancreas’ ability to produce insulin. Regular blood glucose testing is advised for people with LADA at a similar number of tests per day that are advised for people with type 1 diabetes. This means that it is advisable to test your blood sugar levels before each meal and before bed.""",because lada develops slowly someone with lada may be able to produce enough of their own insulin to keep sugar levels under control without needing insulin for a number of months or sometimes even years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes.,"['able', 'enough', 'own', 'initial']","['lada', 'someone', 'lada', 'insulin', 'sugar', 'levels', 'control', 'insulin', 'number', 'months', 'years', 'diagnosis', 'diabetes']","['lada', 'someone', 'lada', 'insulin', 'sugar levels', 'control', 'insulin', 'diagnosis', 'diabetes', 'number']",[],['LADA'],['LADA']

If carbohydrate and calorie intake is kept low enough it can help to promote regular ketosis in which the body breaks down fat tissues to convert them into ketones an alternative energy source to glucose. The breaking down of fat is one reason why very low carbohydrate diets can help with weight loss. Whilst restricted carbohydrate diets can help with weight loss they may also be used primarily for maintaining good blood glucose control.

Cholesterol is carried in the blood by proteins called lipoproteins and it is these that are measured when you have a cholesterol test. These are: High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) LDL is often referred to as ‘bad cholesterol’ because it is this form of cholesterol that can build up in blood vessels. HDL is often referred to as ‘good cholesterol’ because it helps to clear excess LDL out of the blood. Whilst LDL may be called bad cholesterol it is needed for the body and is usually healthy as long as it is kept in balance by a sufficient level of HDL. Triglycerides are another form of blood lipid (blood fat) and are also measured when a cholesterol test is taken. Total cholesterol is the figure of all the different blood fats added together. Ratio of total cholesterol-to-HDL is taken by dividing the total cholesterol figure by the HDL figure. This provides a more reliable indicator of heart health than looking at the total cholesterol or LDL figures.""",cholesterol is a type of blood fat (blood lipid) that forms the membrane of each cell of the body.,[],"['cholesterol', 'type', 'blood', 'fat', 'blood', 'lipid', 'membrane', 'cell', 'body']","['cholesterol', 'blood lipid', 'blood fat', 'cell', 'body', 'membrane']",[],['cholesterol'],['cholesterol']

99,how does Diet affect cholesterol?,complications,"In the past fat has been blamed for high cholesterol levels and heart disease. Whilst some fatty foods such as chips crisps pizza and pies are unhealthy they are high carbohydrate foods as well as high-fat. If you have healthy fats and follow a low-carb diet you’re likely to have as good or better cholesterol levels and heart health than by following a low-fat diet. Healthy fats are from natural sources and minimally processed such as avocado olive oil unprocessed meat oily fish full fat dairy nuts. As we noted above higher total cholesterol does not necessarily indicate unhealthy cholesterol levels. So when reviewing your cholesterol levels look at the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL.

Consider using the plate method which is a good way to ensure you’re having appropriate portion sizes and getting enough vegetables. Low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets are effective for getting a healthier balance of cholesterol. If you need help with modifying your diet arrange an appointment with a dietitian. Regular exercise is also recommended. You should aim to dedicate 30 minutes or more to physical activity at least five times a week.

110,What diet should I use if I have coeliac disease and diabetes?,informationanddefinition,"To return the intestine to a normal pre-coeliac state it is necessary to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. Diet is essential to manage diabetes but when combined with coeliac disease this needs careful attention. When coeliac disease has been diagnosed many of the staple sources of carbohydrate such as bread pasta cereal biscuits and cakes must be avoided. However they can be replaced with gluten-free alternatives. The NHS recognises that gluten free alternatives may not be readily available and can be more expensive and so a number of gluten free foods are available on prescription for people with coeliac disease. here are several key difficulties to be considered when combining a coeliac and diabetes-friendly diet. Having both diabetes and coeliac disease can significantly reduce the number of foods available to eat. As many pre-prepared foods rely on gluten you may need to prepare more foods from scratch. There are many books available about living gluten-free.""",to return the intestine to a normal pre-coeliac state it is necessary to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet.,"['normal', 'pre-coeliac', 'necessary', 'strict', 'free']","['intestine', 'state', 'gluten', 'diet']","['state', 'intestine', 'diet']",['coeliac'],"['diet', 'disease', 'diabetes']","['diet', 'diabetes', 'coeliac disease']"

Therefore keeping your blood sugar within a normal range will reduce this risk. Eating a balanced diet getting regular exercise and giving up smoking is also advised to lessen the risk of oral health problems. Making sure that you visit a dentist every six months ensures that any infection will be treated as early as possible. Minor dental problems can quickly escalate and a routine visit to the dentist will pick up on these.

114,how is Diabetes and gum diseases related?,informationanddefinition,"Having prolonged high blood glucose levels can increase the risk of oral health problems such as gum disease. Gum disease also known as periodontitis is the sixth most common disease in the world. It occurs when bacteria within the mouth begins to form into a sticky plaque which sits on the surface of the tooth. Gum disease is classified on the severity of its development. There are three stages of gum disease: Gingivitis: Gingivitis is the initial stage of gum disease caused by poor oral hygiene and irregular plaque removal from teeth. It is characterised by swollen red and tender gums and it can cause bleeding when brushing. Luckily gingivitis is reversible and through improving your oral hygiene techniques and visiting your dentist or hygienist for advice on a home dental health care program you should be able to reverse this process. Periodontitis (Mild): Untreated gingivitis can lead to mild periodontitis. The conversion of gingivitis to periodontics is more common in people who have a family history of gum disease poor oral hygiene and uncontrolled diabetes. At this stage there will be damage to the gums and bone supporting the teeth. In order to prevent further damage a prompt visit to the dentist is required to prevent further progression. Periodontitis (Severe): This is the most advanced stage of gum disease characterised by significant tissue and bone loss around the teeth. Having prolonged high blood glucose levels can lead to gum disease developing or worsening more quickly but keeping your levels within a normal range reduces the risk of infection spreading. Unfortunately when your body begins to fight an infection blood glucose levels will usually rise in response. Should the infection in your mouth become worse you could have problems with food intake which might affect your diabetes management. Your dentist can help you with your diabetes if you have developed gum disease or another mouth infection.""",having prolonged high blood glucose levels can increase the risk of oral health problems such as gum disease.,"['high', 'oral', 'such']","['blood', 'glucose', 'levels', 'risk', 'health', 'problems', 'gum', 'disease']","['risk', 'blood glucose levels', 'gum disease', 'health problems']",[],"['Diabetes', 'gum', 'diseases']","['Diabetes', 'gum diseases']"

117,what is the relation between Diabetes and Depression?,complications,"According to NICE people who are diagnosed with a chronic physical health problem such as diabetes are 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression than people without it. Depression can have a serious impact on a person’s well being and their ability and motivation to self-manage their condition. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder witnessed in the diabetes community. People with diabetes suffering from depression are at greater risk of suffering from an episode of diabetic burnout which collectively can have adverse effects on physical health and potentially instigate more long term complications both to do with diabetes and independent from the condition.""",according to nice people who are diagnosed with a chronic physical health problem such as diabetes are 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression than people without it.,"['nice', 'chronic', 'physical', 'such', 'likely']","['people', 'health', 'problem', 'diabetes', 'times', 'depression', 'people']","['people', 'health problem', 'diabetes', 'people', 'depression']",[],"['relation', 'Diabetes', 'Depression']","['relation', 'Diabetes', 'Depression']"

For people with diabetes dealing with a lifelong condition and managing the risk of complications can seem like an overwhelming task particularly for newly diagnosed patients. Many diabetics struggle to cope with the requirements feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated. If diabetes is not faced with an attitude of perseverance and defiance often depression will prevail. Depression is the perception of life situations as undesirable. Often when individuals are faced with adverse events or conditions they spend huge amounts of effort trying to escape or deny such circumstances.

142,What are the hypo risks from hot weather?,complications,"Hot weather can increase the risk of hypoglycemia for those on blood glucose lowering medication. The Joslin Diabetes Centre notes that the body’s metabolism is higher in hot and humid weather which can lead to an increased chance of hypoglycemia. Hypos may be slightly harder to spot in hot weather. Don’t be tempted to disregard hypo symptoms such as sweating and tiredness as a result of hot weather as it could be a sign of hypoglycemia. Take extra care when driving and test your blood sugar before and after each journey and stop regularly to check your blood sugar if taking longer journeys. To prevent hypos be prepared to test your blood glucose more often particularly if taking part in physical activity in hot weather. Keep a source of fasting carbohydrate such as glucose tablets to hand. To help treat hypos buy glucose products from the Diabetes Shop. You may need to adjust your insulin levels during changes in temperature. If you are experiencing higher or lower blood sugar levels and need advice about adjusting your insulin levels speak with a member of your healthcare team.""",hot weather can increase the risk of hypoglycemia for those on blood glucose lowering medication.,['hot'],"['weather', 'risk', 'hypoglycemia', 'blood', 'glucose', 'medication']","['weather', 'hypoglycemia', 'risk', 'medication', 'blood glucose']","['hypo', 'hot']","['risks', 'weather']","['risks', 'weather']"

151,What are ketones?,informationanddefinition,"Ketones are an acid remaining when the body burns its own fat. When the body has insufficient insulin it cannot get glucose from the blood into the body’s cells to use as energy and will instead begin to burn fat. The liver converts fatty acids into ketones which are then released into the bloodstream for use as energy. It is normal to have a low level of ketones as ketones will be produced whenever body fat is burned. In people that are insulin dependent such as people with type 1 diabetes however high levels of ketones in the blood can result from taking too little insulin and this can lead to a particularly dangerous condition known as ketoacidosis.""",ketones are an acid remaining when the body burns its own fat.,['own'],"['ketones', 'acid', 'body', 'fat']","['ketones', 'acid', 'body', 'fat']",[],['ketones'],['ketones']

159,How does insulin resistance lead to higher blood sugar levels?,complications,"If insulin resistance exists this therefore reduces the effectiveness of the phase 1 insulin response (as discussed in non-diabetics). The pancreas will release all the insulin it has but it likely won’t be enough because the insulin is less effective. To cope with this the body has to rely on its phase 2 insulin response however this takes some time and therefore in that time without sufficient insulin available blood sugar levels in the type 2 diabetic or pre-diabetic are very likely to rise higher than normal. If the next meal is sufficiently far away the body may have time to catch up and produce enough new (phase 2) insulin to catch up and bring blood sugar levels back to normal. However as mentioned above 1 this therefore further slows down the production capability of insulin which helps to escalate the problem further. If the diabetic or pre-diabetic is used to consuming relatively generous amounts of carbohydrates then the effects of the problem are exaggerated further. Note also that higher sugar levels tend to make people feel both lethargic and more hungry as the less effective insulin means they are less able to get glucose into the cells which need the energy. If a larger amount of food is eaten as a result then the excess calories will start to get absorbed as additional body fat which may contribute to further insulin resistance.""",if insulin resistance exists this therefore reduces the effectiveness of the phase 1 insulin response (as discussed in non-diabetics).,[],"['insulin', 'resistance', 'effectiveness', 'phase', 'insulin', 'response', 'non-diabetics']","['insulin resistance', 'effectiveness', 'non-diabetics', 'insulin response']",['higher'],"['insulin', 'resistance', 'lead', 'blood', 'sugar', 'levels']","['insulin resistance lead', 'blood sugar levels']"

As this occurs the blood vessels narrow and make circulating blood much harder. When this happens to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood and therefore oxygen) a heart attack can occur. Similarly a stroke is when not enough blood can get to the brain and so anything that may limit blood flow increases the risks of a stroke. High blood glucose levels also have this effect on the blood vessels and blood flow so if you smoke when you have diabetes you are putting yourself at a much greater risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.""",smoking and diabetes both increase the risk of heart disease in very similar ways and so when combined they greatly exacerbate the chances of suffering a heart related condition such as a heart attack or stroke.,"['similar', 'related', 'such']","['smoking', 'diabetes', 'risk', 'heart', 'disease', 'ways', 'chances', 'heart', 'condition', 'heart', 'attack', 'stroke']","['smoking', 'diabetes', 'ways', 'risk', 'heart disease', 'chances', 'condition', 'heart attack', 'stroke']",[],"['heart', 'disease', 'risk', 'diabetic']","['heart disease risk', 'diabetic']"

205,How does stress affect my diabetes?,complications,"It is widely recognised that people with diabetes are who regularly stressed are more likely to have poor blood glucose control. One of the reasons for this is that stress hormones such as cortisol increase the amount of sugar in our blood. High levels of cortisol can lead to conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome which is one of the lesser known causes of diabetes. Constant stress and frustration caused by long term problems with blood glucose regulation can also wear people down and cause them to neglect their diabetes care. For example they may start to ignore their blood sugar levels or simply forget to check them or they may adopt poor lifestyle habits such as exercising less eating more ‘junk’ and processed foods drinking more alcohol and smoking. This is known as diabetes burnout. While stress alters blood sugar levels the extent of its impact varies from person to person. Studies into the effects of stress on glucose levels in humans have shown that mental or psychological stress causes a rise in glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes and in most type 1 diabetics although levels can drop in some individuals with type 1. Physical stress such as illness or injury almost always causes blood sugar levels to elevate in people with either type of diabetes.""",it is widely recognised that people with diabetes are who regularly stressed are more likely to have poor blood glucose control.,"['likely', 'poor']","['people', 'diabetes', 'blood', 'glucose', 'control']","['people', 'diabetes', 'blood glucose control']",[],"['stress', 'diabetes']","['stress', 'diabetes']"

","A simple way to do this is to rate your stress level on a scale of 1 to 10 every time you test your blood sugar levels. Make a note of this number and next to it write down your glucose reading. By doing this consistently for a few weeks a pattern should emerge that allows you to see whether high levels of stress coincide with high glucose levels or vice versa.""",a simple way to do this is to rate your stress level on a scale of 1 to 10 every time you test your blood sugar levels.,['simple'],"['way', 'stress', 'level', 'scale', 'time', 'blood', 'sugar', 'levels']","['way', 'stress level', 'scale', 'blood sugar levels']",['glycemic'],"['stress', 'control']","['stress', 'control']"
207,What is the fight-freeze or flight response?,informationanddefinition,"The fight-freeze or flight response is an evolutionary coping mechanism enabling us to deal with threats and stressful situations. When confronted by a threat hormones are released that help us get ready to either fight the threat or fuel a quick escape. There is an increase in glucose for energy increased blood pressure to take fresh oxygen to working muscles and the release of adrenalin for heightened vigilance and alertness. The """"freeze"""" factor has been introduced in recent years as theories have been put forward as to why people sometimes """"freeze"""" in a hopeless shocking situation. It is possible that this ‘rabbit in headlights’ reaction is similar to playing dead which could have helped our ancestors avoid attacks in the wild. Modern humans have fewer physical threats but when faced with psychological pressures such as getting stuck in traffic the brain and body still behaves in the same manner as when faced with a physical threat (i.e. the fight-freeze or flight response). However in people with diabetes this instinctive response does not work as well. Insulin is needed to get stored energy (glucose) into the body’s cells. But in people who have diabetes this process is hampered as insulin is either not produced (as with type 1 diabetes) or not used effectively (type 2 diabetes) resulting in the build-up of excess glucose in the bloodstream.""",the fight-freeze or flight response is an evolutionary coping mechanism enabling us to deal with threats and stressful situations.,"['evolutionary', 'stressful']","['fight', 'freeze', 'flight', 'response', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'threats', 'situations']","['coping mechanism', 'flight', 'response', 'threats', 'situations']",[],"['fight', 'freeze', 'flight', 'response']","['fight-freeze', 'flight response']"

For adults aged between 40 and 50 screening should be considered. For people who have higher risk factors (ethnicity family history obesity) screening should be conducted beforehand. Measuring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can help diagnose cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. According to diagnostic guidelines set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO) a HbA1c value of: 6% (below 42 mmol/mol) is considered non-diabetic 6-6.4% (42 to 47 mmol/mol) indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation and is considered prediabetes 6.5% or more (48 mmol/mol and above) indicates the presence of type 2 diabetes.

230,Does stress impact blood sugar levels?,informationanddefinition,"There is an ever-growing amount of scientific literature relating stress and blood glucose levels. When stressed, the parasympathetic nervous system releases a slew of hormones that work to help you get through stressful situations. Evolutionary, this stress response would be the result of immediate danger to your life, thus these hormones work to increase heart rate, increase blood vessel diameter, reduce saliva production, reroute blood from the digestive organs to the muscles (slowing down digestion) and most importantly, convert glycogen to glucose for immediate use. Considering the stressful society we live in it can be asserted that these hormones that should be released to help keep us safe from predators are now actually damaging our health by increasing blood glucose levels when they do not need to be raised. Stress reduction techniques are invaluable for people that have to monitor their blood glucose levels.

This involves a process of trial and error with different types of foods and eventually results in an in-depth knowledge of your bodies response to certain foods. Using this technique will essentially teach you how specific foods will impact your blood glucose level and to what extent you should be eating them. To use this technique simply find a food item that you want to eat, but are unsure about. After consuming a small amount of said food, proceed to check your blood glucose levels. If theyre within a good range, at a later date eat a slightly larger portion and check again. Repeat this process until you eat an amount that raises your blood glucose higher than you deem acceptable.

In addition to its role in glucose storage, insulin has been shown to increase kidney re-absorption of sodium. When you follow a low carb diet your insulin levels are lowered. This results in the kidneys drastically lowering their rate of re-absorption of sodium and water, leading to lower sodium levels and blood pressure. This makes the Low Carb Program an excellent dietary strategy to combat high blood pressure. For other practical ways to lower your salt intake, look to stay away from highly processed meats like bacon, sausages, cold cuts and frozen breaded meats. Canned and pickled vegetables, canned soup, seasonings and condiments can all be chocked full of salt. Its definitely worth checking the labels.","one aspect of low carb dieting that is especially helpful for heart health is related to insulins impact on the kidneys, and thus your sodium levels.","['low', 'helpful']","['aspect', 'carb', 'dieting', 'heart', 'health', 'insulins', 'impact', 'kidneys', 'sodium', 'levels']","['aspect', 'dieting', 'heart health', 'insulins impact', 'sodium levels', 'kidneys']",['low'],"['carb', 'help', 'sodium', 'levels']","['help', 'sodium levels']"

That means cutting out things like chocolate, cake, ice-cream, and sugary drinks. Also looking to decrease carbohydrate consumption to under 150g per day. That means cutting back on starchy foods like pasta, rice, bread, potato, pastries, cereal and crisps. Look instead to eat fresh vegetables and increase your healthy fat consumption by eating cuts of meat, fish, dairy (excluding milk) seeds, nuts, avocado and olives/olive oil.

Once your body realises that this is a lifestyle change and not simply a week long diet that will soon be over, you will start shedding more fat. Some factors that may be hindering your weight loss include consuming more carbs than you realise, not exercising frequently and (again) your body adjusting. Another excellent weight loss technique is intermittent fasting. This involves a period of around 16hrs in which you do not eat, followed by an 8hr period within which you consume your food for the day. This fits in perfectly with LCHF dieting as your body becomes adapted to burning fat for energy (of which you have stores) instead of sugar which is limited. Although if youre only just starting the program I’d say to be patient and see where youre at in a few weeks before you start looking to implement Intermittent fasting.
