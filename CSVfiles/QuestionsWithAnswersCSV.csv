QUESTION,ID,ANSWER
When was insulin first discovered?,0,"It wasn’t until 1921 that insulin was physically extracted. This was done by a team from the University of Toronto which included Frederick Banting and J Macleod who were given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923."""
How many types of insulin are there?,1,"There are 4 types of insulin based on how soon the insulin starts working (onset) when it works the hardest (peak time) and how long it lasts in your body (duration). However each person responds to insulin in his or her own way.That is why onset peak time and duration are given as ranges. The types of insulin are: Rapid-acting insulin (Lispro) reaches the blood within 15 minutes after injection. It peaks 30 to 90 minutes later and may last as long as 5 hours. Short-acting (regular) insulin usually reaches the blood within 30 minutes after injection. It peaks 2 to 4 hours later and stays in the blood for about 4 to 8 hours. Intermediate acting (NPH and lente) insulins reach the blood 2 to 6 hours after injection. They peak 4 to 14 hours later and stay in the blood for about 14 to 20 hours. Long acting (ultralente) insulin takes 6 to 14 hours to start working. It has no peak or a very small peak 10 to 16 hours after injection. It stays in the blood between 20 and 24 hours.Some insulins come mixed together. For example you can buy regular and NPH insulins already mixed in one bottle. They make it easier to inject two kinds of insulin at the same time.However you can’t adjust the amount of one insulin without also changing how much you get of the other insulin."""
What determines the strengths of insulin?,2,"Insulins come dissolved in liquids at different strengths. Most people use U-100 insulin. This means it has 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of fluid. Be sure that the syringe you use matches the insulin strength. U-100 insulin needs a U-100 syringe. In Europe and Latin America U-40 insulin is also used. If you’re outside the United States be certain to match your insulin strength with the correct size syringe."""
What are insulin Additives and allergies?,3,All insulins have added ingredients to keep them fresh and help them work better. Intermediate- and long-acting insulins also have ingredients to make them act longer. Today’s insulins are very pure. Allergic reactions are rare.
How does alcohol affect Blood Sugar?,4,"Alcohol can have a confusing effect on blood sugar levels because it prevents the liver from producing glucose. One consequence of this is that hypoglycemia can occur after a night of drinking. As a result people with diabetes are often advised to eat something to compensate for the expected drop in blood sugar levels. Alcohol does affect different people in different ways so if in doubt test your blood glucose to see how alcohol affects you. Some people may find it all too easy to let diabetes drift out of their mind when having alcohol and not worry too much about sugar levels. However it is advisable to test blood sugar levels whenever possible to get an idea of how different drinks affect your sugar levels."""
What is Alström Syndrome?,5,"Alström syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterised by a number of features notably including extreme sensitivity to light hearing problems heart problems obesity and type 2 diabetes. Most of the features of Alström syndrome are treatable although health complications of the condition are common. It is estimated that around 200 families in the UK may be affected by Alström syndrome."""
What does Alström Syndrome Symptoms includes?,6,"There are a number of common features of Alström syndrome which include: Eye problems: Including retinal degeneration (progressive worsening of vision) nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and photophobia (extreme sensitivity to light) Hearing impairment Cardiomyopathy: Disorder of the heart muscle Obesity Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: Leading to type 2 diabetes Hypertriglyceridaemia: Abnormally high triglyceride levels in the blood Renal dysfunction: Kidney disorders Heart and eye problems will often be diagnosed shortly after birth whilst hearing problems usually occur before the age of 10. Children with Alström syndrome will usually gain weight quickly despite eating healthily and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes within childhood is common. The features which a child develops as well as the severity of the symptoms can vary from child to child. Additional complications which can follow include: Bladder and bowel problems Bone and joint problems: Including arthritis Hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Hypothyroidism: Underactive thyroid function."""
what is the causes of Alström syndrome?,7,"Alström syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ALMS1 gene. A mutation in this gene is known to affect a protein related to cilia minute whiskers which are present on the surface of cells. If each parent has a mutation in the ALMS1 gene there is a 1 in 4 chance that each child they have will develop Alström syndrome."""
How is Alström syndrome diagnosed?,8,"A diagnosis of Alström syndrome may be made based on presence of the symptoms. If confirmation is needed genetic testing can be used to identify mutation of the ALMS1 gene."""
Can I get an artificial pancreas?,9,"There are three main artificial pancreas systems being worked on by researchers: Closed-loop artificial pancreas Bionic pancreas Implanted artificial pancreas."""
What is an artificial pancreas?,10,"The system is still being tested for safety and effectiveness and as of 2016 home and clinical trials of the system have been completed in participants with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Research is being conducted worldwide and each team’s expertise to their respective products is helping to speed up the process of devices coming to market."""
What is an Autoimmune Disease?,11,"Autoimmune disease refers to illness or disorder that occurs when healthy tissue (cells) get destroyed by the body’s own immune system. The term autoimmune disease is one that many people with diabetes - in particular those with type 1 diabetes - will have come across or be familiar with. In the case of type 1 diabetes the disease-fighting system mistakes healthy cells in the pancreas for foreign harmful invaders and attacks them leaving the body unable to produce its own insulin and keep levels of blood glucose under control. There are more than 80 different types of autoimmune disease from multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes to coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The immune system is the body’s protection against harmful substances such as bacteria viruses and toxins all of which contain harmful antigens. To counter this the immune system produces and sends antibodies (special proteins) to identify destroy these antigens. However in some cases the immune system cannot distinguish between healthy harmless tissue and antigens and as a result it attacks and destroys normal tissue (in people with diabetes the cells mistakenly targeted are the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas). This autoimmune reaction (or ‘attack’) is what triggers the development of an autoimmune disease."""
What causes the immune system to act this way?,12,"The exact cause of autoimmune disease is unknown although there are many theories about what causes it to malfunction including: Bacteria or virus Drugs Chemical irritants Environmental irritants Studies have shown that autoimmune disorders often run in families and are much more common in women."""
What are the most common autoimmune diseases?,13,"Of the 80-plus autoimmune disorders the most common ones include: Addison’s disease - immune system attacks the adrenal gland disrupting production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. Coeliac disease - autoimmune attack on substances found inside gluten damages the surface of the small bowel disrupting the body’s ability to take in essential nutrients from food. Graves’ disease - the small thyroid gland is attacked by the immune system leading to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Hashimoto’s disease - similar to Graves’ disease but this time damage to the thyroid gland lead to an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Multiple sclerosis - myelin sheaths which protect the nerve fibres carrying messages to and from the brain are targeted by the immune system causing behind scarring (known as sclerosis). Reactive arthritis - immune system is tricked into thinking a previous infection is still present and attacks healthy tissue causing it to become inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis - cells that line your joints are targeted by the autoimmune reaction causing joints and surrounding tissues to become swollen stiff and painful. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - immune system targets healthy tissue causing inflammation of the skin and joints and can affect internal organs. Type 1 diabetes - immune system destroys cells within the pancreas that produce the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin."""
What are the symptoms of autoimmune diesease?,14,"The symptoms of autoimmune disease vary between types but the common indicators are fatigue fever general malaise (feeling ill) joint pain and skin rash. Symptoms worsen during flare-ups and reduce during remission. The common and most noticeable signs of type 1 diabetes are: Increased thirst (polydipsia) Frequent/increased urination (polyuria) Extreme tiredness (fatigue) Sudden or unexplained weight loss"""
what is Binge Eating Disorders?,15,Binge eating is recognised as an eating disorder in which people feel compelled to overeat and feel powerless to be able to control their eating pattern. Binge eating may result from psychological reasons but can also result from rises and falls in blood glucose levels from eating food with high carbohydrate content.
What counts as binge eating?,16,"If you eat large amounts of food in a short period of time without feeling you are able to control your eating this is a sign of binge eating. Compulsive eating such as constantly needing to snack on high calorie foods between meal times is also a sign of binge eating."""
What can cause binge eating to take place?,17,"There are a number of psychological reasons which can trigger binge eating. The NHS state that around 50% of people that binge eat have had depression at some point in their life. Negative feelings including being stressed anxious sad helpless guilty or bored can cause people to eat as a conscious or unconscious way of momentarily blocking out the negative emotion. In some cases people may eat to amplify the negative feelings. Binge eating may also occur in people trying to lose weight through methods such as greatly restricted calorie content or missing meals which can lead to intense hunger and feeling a need to binge eat. It is common for binge eating to lead to other negative feelings such as guilt regret or further loss of control shortly after eating which can trigger a vicious circle of continued binge eating."""
How can hunger follow after recently eating?,18,"It is not unusual to experience hunger soon after eating snacks or meals with particularly fast acting carbohydrate content. Typical examples of foods with quickly absorbed carbohydrate include: Sugary foods Potato based foods Refined carbohydrates such as white bread white pasta and white rice When we eat quickly absorbed sources of carbohydrate our blood glucose levels will initially rise rapidly and should trigger our pancreas to release insulin. This usually presents problems for people with diabetes. In type 2 diabetes the body doesn’t respond as well as it should to insulin and so it takes longer for the body to produce sufficient insulin to cope with the rise in blood sugar. People with type 1 diabetes will inject insulin to help the body cope with the increase in blood sugar levels but when we eat fast acting carbohydrate it can take more than 2 hours for enough insulin to be absorbed to adequately cope with the increase in blood glucose levels. When our blood sugar levels rise to high levels and we don’t have sufficient insulin in our blood to cope it can often cause us to feel both tired and hungry and can therefore make us crave more food which can lead to vicious circle forming. Another reason for feeling intense hunger after consuming too much quick acting carbohydrate is that once our insulin has caught up the insulin may bring our blood glucose levels too low which frequently triggers strong feelings of hunger."""
Are there any body parts I shouldn’t get pierced?,19,"As someone with diabetes you should avoid areas with poor circulation such as: Ankles Shins Buttocks Or your favoured areas for insulin injection/shots. You should also choose a licensed or accredited body piercer to carry out the work and let them know about your condition so that they can tailor the procedure and aftercare tips to your needs."""
How could bone marrow transplants treat type 1 diabetes?,20,"Type 1 diabetes results from the body’s immune system targeting and killing its own beta cells which produce insulin in the pancreas.Even if people receive islet cell transplants their immune system will still try to kill off the transplanted cells so transplant recipients need to take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent or delay their transplanted cells being destroyed.Bone marrow transplantation is an attempt to reset the body’s immune system to no longer attack the pancreas’s insulin producing cells."""
How is a bone marrow transplant carried out?,21,"The process detailed follows that used by Dr Julio Voltarelli. The first stage was to remove a sample of stem cells from the patient’s existing bone marrow. The next stage involved the patients receiving a high dosage of immunosuppressive drugs to destroy the immune system in the body. With no immune system to defend the body patients were kept in isolation away from sources of infection. The bone marrow stem cells were then transplanted back within the bone marrow."""
Was bone marrow transplantation successful in treating type 1 diabetes?,22,Dr Voltarelli treated 23 patients that had been newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and followed the patients up at intervals. A follow up carried out in 2009 showed that 12 patients had been able to stay free of insulin injections for over 3 years and another 8 received only intermittent injections through a five year period.
How does brittle diabetes develop and what is it associated with?,23,"Brittle diabetes has a number of potential causes. It can be caused by absorption problems in the intestines. This includes delayed stomach emptying drug interactions insulin absorption issues and malfunctioning hormones. Severely low blood sugar levels may also create thyroid and adrenal gland problems. Gastroperesis delayed stomach emptying can affect the rate at which food glucose and insulin is absorbed into the bloodstream. Brittle diabetes is often associated with psychological issues such as stress and depression."""
Is brittle diabetes different from stable diabetes?,24,"All people with diabetes will a certain level of blood glucose level fluctuation. However when these shifts are not extreme or over-frequent they do not impair the ability to lead a normal life. With brittle diabetes however the fluctuations are more serious and tend to result in frequent hospital visits interruption to employment and can often contribute to psychological issues such as stress."""
What is the life expectancy with brittle diabetes?,25,"The life expectancy for someone with brittle diabetes is no different to someone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In fact brittle diabetes can also be described poorly controlled type 2 diabetes."""
Is brittle diabetes common?,26,"Brittle diabetes is rare but serious. Around 3 in 1 000 people with type 1 diabetes mellitus will develop brittle diabetes."""
Will I get brittle diabetes?,27,"Those people suffering from psychological problems including stress and depression face a greater risk of developing brittle diabetes. This can be as simple as psychological problems causing neglect of diabetes care (such as stopping eating healthily taking medication or exercising regularly).Blood sugar control quickly becomes less regular and imbalances in the metabolism can exacerbate this.Furthermore psychological problems can then become worse causing a symbiotic cycle which reinforces brittle diabetes.Brittle diabetes is most likely to affect women who are overweight between the ages of 15 and 30. """
How is brittle diabetes treated?,28,"The most effective treatment for brittle diabetes is to identify and correct underlying physical or psychological problems. Glucose instability is often able to be tracked using blood tests. Often treatment seeks to address behavioural psychological or environmental causes. This can be a lengthy and difficult process of treatment.Treatment may involve trying to lessen stress and psychotherapy has also proven to be effective in the treatment of brittle diabetes."""
Can People with Diabetes Give Blood?,29,"People who are on insulin therapy are not allowed to give blood when it comes to giving blood there are a number of conditions that can make you ineligible. Unfortunately people with diabetes won’t in most cases be eligible to give blood. At least not in the UK. This is because NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) maintain a policy of refusing blood donations from anybody who may be placed at risk by giving blood. In many cases this includes people with diabetes."""
What are the conditions for giving blood?,30,"There are a number of conditions that may prevent you from giving blood. Some of them although not always directly caused by diabetes can be related such as: Ulcers related to numbness (perhaps caused by diabetic neuropathy) or any other numbness-related heart condition. If you have had complicated dental work: over time prolonged exposure to high blood glucose levels can damage the teeth giving people with diabetes a heightened risk of needing complicated dental work such as a tooth extraction. If you have had a pancreatic tissue transplant you will not be eligible to give blood."""
How to care for Someone with Diabetes?,31,"Usually the youngest and eldest may need support with their diabetes. Not everyone with diabetes requires specific caring for but certain people notably the young and old may need help and support with managing their diabetes."""
How to care for a child with diabetes?,32,"Children with diabetes will usually have type 1 diabetes which requires regular insulin injections. It is important that injections are taken at the right time that the correct dose is given and the correct amount of carbohydrate is taken at appropriate times of day. The child’s parents will be able to advise on these matters. Note that some activities such as exercise may have an impact on blood sugar levels. Any prolonged period of activity will tend to lower blood sugar levels. Periods of illness or stress may raise blood sugar levels. It is therefore important to recognise any symptoms of high and low blood sugar levels. Some children may be comfortable managing their own diabetes however it is recommended to be aware of the symptoms of low and high sugar levels and to ensure that they do not miss a scheduled meal or dose. For more detailed information on looking after a child with diabetes see our section on diabetes and parenting."""
How to care for a partner with diabetes?,33,"If your partner had diabetes it is well worth building an understanding of your partner’s condition. By understanding diabetes you can put yourself in a better position to offer appropriate support. Diabetes is a complicated and all encompassing illness and many people with diabetes will value the chance to share issues around their diabetes with their partners. Read more on caring for a partner with diabetes."""
How to care for an elderly person with diabetes?,34,"Whilst some elderly people have exceptional diabetes control age can make some aspects of diabetes management more difficult. The presence of other conditions including neuropathy (nerve damage) retinopathy (retinal damage) arthritis or Alzheimer’s disease will likely require extra care and support to enable them to manage their diabetes. Elderly people may be less able to recognise high or low blood sugar symptoms and so it is important to be able to recognise these symptoms."""
What are the Causes of Type 1 Diabetes?,35,"A multitude of causes of type 1 diabetes have been studied. Type 1 diabetes belongs to a group of conditions known as autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are when the body incorrectly identifies its own useful cells as an attacking organism. In type 1 diabetes it is the beta cells in the pancreas which produce insulin that are wrongfully targeted and killed off by specific antibodies created by the body’s immune system. Researchers have been investigating what may cause the immune system to act in this way but to date researchers have theories but no concrete proof."""
What are type 1 diabetes triggers?,36,"Researchers have hypothesised that whilst some people are have a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes there is likely to be an environmental factor that triggers the initial development of type 1 diabetes. Some of the possible triggers that have been suggested include: Viral infection. Vaccines. Low levels of vitamin D. Cow’s milk Increased insulin demand."""
What are the causes of Type 2 Diabetes?,37,"There is no single cause of type 2 diabetes. It is difficult to be conclusive when identifying a cause for a long term condition such as type 2 diabetes when a number of contributing factors may be present. Key to the development of type 2 diabetes is the body’s inability to properly respond to insulin. Researchers from around the globe have studied data and carried out experiments to try to understand what may cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes to develop."""
what are risk factors for type 2 diabetes?,38,"There are a number risk factors that are closely linked to type 2 diabetes but research is yet to provide clear answers as to how much these factors may be a cause or otherwise an association. Type 2 diabetes risk factors include: Carrying too much excess body fat Having high blood pressure or cholesterol. Having a close family member with type 2 diabetes Having previously had gestational diabetes Read more about risk factors for type 2 diabetes"""
How is diabetes caused in children?,39,"The actual causes of the diabetic condition are little understood in both children and adults. It is widely speculated that diabetes occurred when inherited genetic characteristics are triggered by environmental factors such as diet or exercise. Many type 1 diabetic children do not have diabetes in their families however so the exact cause remains a mystery.Type 2 diabetes amongst children is usually caused by an extremely bad diet from a very young age coupled with a sedentary lifestyle without exercise."""
What symptoms do children with diabetes exhibit?,40,"Like adults a number of symptoms may give early warning that diabetes has developed.One or more of the following symptoms may be associated with diabetes:Thirst Tiredness Weight loss Frequent urination Amongst children specific symptoms may include stomach aches headaches and behavioural problems. Recurrent tummy pains and an unexplainable history of illness should be treated as possible heralds of diabetes."""
How are children with diabetes treated?,41,"After diagnosis a child will usually be referred to a regional diabetes specialist. Most children with diabetes are cared for by their hospital as opposed to their GP. Because type 1 typically means that the vast majority of islet cells have been destroyed and insufficient or zero insulin can be produced the only certain method of treating diabetes in children is insulin treatment. Usually a diabetes care team will plan an insulin regimen suited to individual requirements and habits of the child. Fast-acting insulin will generally be administered during the day and nocturnal levels will be controlled by a slow-acting dose. Insulin pumps are also common amongst children. Sometimes in the initial period following diagnosis small children will only need a very small dose of insulin but this will unfortunately change as they grow older and larger. Good glucose control is essential in the management of all diabetics’ conditions.Treating type 2 diabetes in children depends entirely on how far their condition has developed. At an early stage it may be possible to treat the condition with an abrupt lifestyle change incorporating a healthier diet and exercise. """
What can the parents of children with diabetes do?,42,"Keeping a strict eye on the blood glucose levels of your child avoiding lows and highs can be a large part of being a parent of a child with diabetes. Parents must be aware that children with diabetes have diet restrictions and that their activity levels need to be closely monitored. Initially and throughout the lifetime of the disease diabetes can be a serious strain. Patients and their families alike should know that support is available. Initially the procedure for management and treatment of the disease can seem very complicated. Understanding how the disease affects your child being adaptable and patient are essential to successfully managing diabetes. Some things to bear in mind include: You may have to deliver insulin injections at first and even if you do not need to then you should know how to. There are two major delivery sites above the abdomen and in the thigh but your healthcare team will elaborate. You should become familiar with the symptoms of low blood glucose and also diabetic ketoacidosis. As well as recognising these conditions you should know what to do if they occur. Monitor your child’s blood sugar levels and as soon as they are old enough teach them how to do this. Similarly as children become older they need to learn how to administer their own insulin injections. Make sure that people know your son or daughter is diabetic and that they also know what to do if the symptoms of low blood glucose manifest themselves.Ensure that glucose is always available."""
how to control Type 1 Diabetes?,43,"Type 1 diabetes can be controlled by simple tasks that can be established as a routine. Type 1 diabetes can be controlled by simple tasks that can be established as a routine in type 1 diabetes the body produces very little insulin and so we have to try our best to perform the job of our pancreas. The task is not an easy one and sometimes control can slip up away from the best of us. This article serves as a guide to help you get your control back on track."""
How to controlling Type 2 Diabetes?,44,"Type 2 diabetes can be tamed by monitoring blood glucose levels diet and exercise Type 2 diabetes can be managed by monitoring blood glucose levels diet and exercise With a bit of knowledge and dedication type 2 diabetes can be controlled.For those looking to get stuck into type 2 diabetes management we’ve compiled a guide to help you understand the condition and improve your health."""
How can blood glucose testing help?,45,"HbA1c gives a general big picture of how well controlled your sugar levels are while blood glucose testing can help fill in some of the detail. Target blood glucose levels for people with type 2 diabetes are: 4 to 7 mmol/l before meals and when fasting 4 to 8.5 mmol/l 2 hours following meals. Not everyone with type 2 diabetes is given blood glucose testing supplies on prescription. If your doctor is not willing to prescribe testing supplies you will need to consider whether to buy testing supplies. Whilst testing supplies are far from cheap they can often be very useful for those looking to get to grips with understanding how blood glucose levels vary following different meals."""
What can we learn from an HbA1c test?,46,"The target HbA1c value for people with type 2 diabetes is 6.5% or 48 mmol/mol.If you get an HbA1c result at this level or below you’re on the right track with your diabetes control. If your HbA1c result is above this target there is room for some improvement. You may need to incorporate a little more activity into your week make some changes to your diet or ask your doctor to prescribe a different form of medication.If there’s one criticism of HbA1c it’s that it doesn’t always make it easy to work out which individual changes are the most effective for lowering your blood sugar levels or which elements of your lifestyle are having a negative influence."""
What are type 2 medications?,47,"Type 2 diabetes medication can help blood glucose levels from rising too high. Some of us may be able to keep our blood glucose levels in the right range without needing medication but the majority of people with type 2 diabetes take some form of medication. Whilst most people tend to move onto stronger medication as they live longer with diabetes it is not hugely uncommon for some people with type 2 diabetes to move onto less strong medication or even come off medication if they are able to make significant improvements to their blood glucose levels."""
What are the cost of Diabetes?,48,"The cost of diabetes to the NHS is over £1.5m an hour or 10% of the NHS budget for England and Wales. This equates to over £25 000 being spent on diabetes every minute.In total an estimated £14 billion pounds is spent a year on treating diabetes and its complications with the cost of treating complications representing the much higher cost.The prevalence of diabetes is estimated to rise to 4 million by 2025."""
what are the cost of diabetes complications?,49,"A 2012 report from the London School of Economics estimates that the cost of prescribing medication for complications of diabetes is around 3 to 4 times the cost of prescribing diabetes medication. Medication for cardiovascular disease constitutes the largest proportion of prescriptions costs for people with diabetes. Annual inpatient care to treat short and long term complications of diabetes is estimated at between £1 800 and £2 500 per patient.This compares with annual outpatient costs which includes the cost of medications and monitoring supplies estimated at between £300 and £370 per patient."""
what are C-peptide Test?,50,C-peptide tests examine how much insulin your body produces. A C-peptide test is a blood test which is carried out to find out how much insulin your body is producing. This may be useful for determining whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes or whether you have insulin resistance.
What is C-peptide?,51,C-peptide is released at the same time as insulin. For each molecule of insulin produced there is a molecule of c-peptide. C-peptide does not itself influence blood sugar. C-peptide is a useful marker of insulin production because c-peptide tends to remain in the blood longer than insulin.
Why is a c-peptide test done?,52,"A c-peptide test can be performed for any of the following reasons: To distinguish whether you may have type 1 or type 2 diabetes To investigate whether you have insulin resistance To ascertain causes of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) To monitor insulin production after the removal of a tumour of the pancreas (insulinoma)"""
How is the test performed?,53,"To measure level of c-peptide a fasting blood test is taken. You will be asked not to eat or drink (certain fluids) for 8 to 12 hours before the test. If you take blood glucose lowering medication you will likely be asked to stop taking these in the run up to the test. For the blood test itself a sample of blood will be taken from your arm and it shouldn’t take much more than a minute. Levels of c-peptide will be measured as well as the blood glucose level."""
what does C-peptide test results show?,54,"c-peptide test results are classed within 3 ranges/values. Normal range:The normal range for a c-peptide test is: 0.51 to 2.72 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL) This may also be expressed as: 0.17-0.90 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L). The following information serves only as a guide. Your doctor should be able to advise you as to what the test results may indicate. Low test result values Low levels of c-peptide and high blood glucose levels could be an indicator of type 1 diabetes. Low levels of both c-peptide and blood glucose could indicate liver disease a severe infection or Addison’s disease. High test result values: High levels of c-peptide with a low level of blood glucose could be an indication of insulin resistance either type 2 diabetes or Cushing’s syndrome. High levels of c-peptide but low blood glucose levels may be a result of insulinoma (a tumour of the pancreas) unless glucose lowering medication has influenced the result."""
What is Critical Illness Cover?,55,"Critical illness cover is almost as it says in the name essentially it is an insurance policy that will pay out a lump sum upon diagnosis of an illness covered under the plan. Critical illnesses that are covered under each policy vary between insurance providers. Therefore you should always check the documentation and policy wording before selecting your policy to make sure that it is right for you."""
Why do I need Critical Illness Cover?,56,"A critical illness policy is designed to offer peace of mind and security for you and your loved ones should you become ill and possibly not able to work as a result of a critical illness or serious injury. The amount of cover is dependant on what you would want the cover for and can vary considerably based on your individual circumstances and needs. It can also be based on affordability and simply how much you are willing to pay for the cover. Some things to consider when applying for an amount of critical illness cover are: Paying your mortgage Monthly outgoings (i.e. utilities loans credit cards) Paying school fees Private medical treatment."""
Have Critical Illness products been available in the past?,57,"Historically there have only been a couple of providers to offer critical illness cover for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Since November 2011 there has been a sole insurance provider who offered a Critical Illness Cover product for people with diabetes."""
How does Critical Illness for Diabetes work?,58,"Generally you would only be able to obtain critical illness cover if the individual with diabetes has good control is a non-smoker and no complications such as: Retinopathy Neuropathy Raised BMI levels Cover is available for people with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. Some providers will have standard exclusions on their policy which could be cardiovascular conditions and anything relating to the eyes."""
What does Critical Illness cost?,59,"The good news is that the cover is certainly more affordable and reasonably priced now than it has ever been in the past. There are a number of reasons for the general reduction in premiums and in ratings for diabetes such as: Better mortality data (people living longer and healthier lives) Greater competition Knowledge of the condition has developed The advance of medication for diabetes. It should be noted that critical illness cover is generally more expensive than life insurance for the simple reason that it is 6 times more likely that an individual will make a claim."""
What is cystic fibrosis?,60,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a genetic mutation of the CFTR gene which causes the normal flow of salt and water through the body to be blocked. This results in the body producing unusually thick mucus which can cause problems in the body such as raising the risk of dangerous lung infections and preventing the pancreas from working properly to digest food. The symptoms of cystic fibrosis are usually spotted within the first year of a baby’s life and include: Particularly salty-tasting skin Persistent coughing Shortness of breath Frequent chest and lung infections Poor growth or weight gain.Cystic fibrosis affects digestion and so a high calorie diet is needed to maintain a healthy weight."""
what are the symptoms of diabetes in cystic fibrosis?,61,"The following symptoms of diabetes may be noticed in people with cystic fibrosis: Increased thirst Increased need to urinate Excessive tiredness Unexplained weight loss Unexplained decline in lung function."""
what are the diagnosis of diabetes in cystic fibrosis?,62,"It is important that a diagnosis of diabetes is not delayed to prevent deterioration of lung function. If you have the symptoms of diabetes contact your health team who will be able to arrange a diagnosis. An oral glucose tolerance test or continuous glucose monitoring may be used to diagnose CFRD."""
what are the causes of Cystic fibrosis?,63,"Cystic fibrosis can cause scarring of the pancreas which can affect the organ’s ability to produce insulin. Another contributing factor is insulin resistance which can also occur in people with cystic fibrosis. The impact of insulin resistance can be significantly increased whilst or as a result of taking corticosteroids to treat symptoms of cystic fibrosis."""
what are the treatment for Cystic fibrosis?,64,"Treatment for cystic fibrosis related diabetes should aim to address the issue of keeping blood glucose levels under control whilst enabling someone with CFRD to get sufficient nutrition to maintain a healthy weight.CFRD is usually treated with insulin. Insulin helps to keep blood glucose levels under control which can to prevent health complications related to diabetes developing and helps the body to get the energy needed to keep a healthy weight. Oral hypoglycemics (tablets) may be taken if there are sufficient difficulties in taking insulin. Regular blood glucose testing is an important part of the management of CFRD. Insulin requirements may be higher during times when corticosteroids are taken to manage the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Management of diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis presents a different set of challenges to people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and people with CFRD should be referred to a consultant with a specialism in managing patients with CFRD. The combination of diabetes with cystic fibrosis can be a challenge and psychological support can be an important part of managing the two conditions as well as accepting your diagnosis."""
Waht are symptoms of dehydration?,65,"The symptoms of dehydration include: Thirst Headache Dry mouth and dry eyes Dizziness Tiredness Dark yellow coloured urine."""
What are the causes and contributory factors of dehydration?,66,"The following factors can contribute to dehydration. Having more of these factors present at one time can raise the risk of dehydration: Insufficient fluid intake Hot weather Strenuous exercise High blood glucose levels Alcohol Diarrhoea Vomiting Diabetes insipidus."""
What are symptoms of severe dehydration?,67,"The symptoms of severe dehydration include:Low blood pressure Sunken eyes A weak pulse and/or rapid heartbeat Feeling confused Lethargy"""
How does LADA compare with other diabetes types?,68,"LADA is sometimes referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. This is not an official term but it does illustrate the fact that LADA is a form of type 1 diabetes that shares some characteristics with type 2 diabetes. As a form of type 1 diabetes LADA is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks and kills off insulin producing cells. The reasons why LADA can often be mistaken for type 2 diabetes is it develops over a longer period of time than type 1 diabetes in children or younger adults. Whereas type 1 diabetes in children tends to develop quickly sometimes within the space of days LADA develops more slowly sometimes over a period of years. The slower onset of diabetes symptoms being presented in people over 35 years may lead a GP to initially diagnose a case of LADA as type 2 diabetes."""
How common is LADA?,69,"According to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study found that antibodies specific to LADA cases are found in between 6% and 10% of diabetes cases. Amongst people diagnosed with diabetes at an age younger than 35 years old LADA may account for up to 25% of cases."""
How is LADA diagnosed?,70,"Often LADA will be initially diagnosed as diabetes by way of the usual diagnosis procedures. Following a diagnosis of diabetes your doctor or you may have reason to suspect that the type of diabetes present is LADA. Determining the presence of LADA is achieved by examining the presence of elevated levels of pancreatic autoantibodies amongst patients who have recently been diagnosed with diabetes but do not require insulin. A GAD Antibody test can measure the presence of these autoantibodies. These antibodies can identify LADA and also can predict the rate of progression towards insulin dependency. Another test that can be performed is a C-peptide test. However C-peptide tests may not always draw conclusive results in people with LADA at an earlier stage of the condition’s development."""
How is LADA treated?,71,"Because LADA develops slowly someone with LADA may be able to produce enough of their own insulin to keep sugar levels under control without needing insulin for a number of months or sometimes even years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes. Insulin will almost certainly be required at some point in the future. In some cases insulin therapy may be postponed. However there is evidence to suggest that starting insulin treatment soon after a diagnosis of LADA will help to better preserve the pancreas’ ability to produce insulin. Regular blood glucose testing is advised for people with LADA at a similar number of tests per day that are advised for people with type 1 diabetes. This means that it is advisable to test your blood sugar levels before each meal and before bed."""
What complications are related to LADA?,72,"Ketoacidosis is a short-term complication of LADA particularly once the pancreas has lost much of its ability to produce insulin. People with LADA should be aware of the signs of ketoacidosis and how to test for ketones if needed. The risks of long term complications of diabetes will be similar to the risks in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The possible long term complications of diabetes include:Heart disease and stroke Retinopathy (retinal disease) Nephropathy (kidney disease) Neuropathy (nerve disease) Foot problems."""
What is MODY diabetes?,73,"Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young affects approximately one or two per cent of people who have diabetes and may often go unrecognised in its early stages. It is a form of diabetes that develops before the patient reaches 25. It also runs in families and can pass from one generation to the next. MODY does not always require insulin treatment."""
Why is MODY inherited so easily?,74,"MODY is directly caused by the change in a single gene and all children of an affected parent have a 50 per cent chance of inheriting this gene and consequently developing MODY themselves."""
Why does MODY differ from other strains of diabetes?,75,"Knowing and understanding MODY and even the different forms of MODY (six types have been identified) means that the affected person can be treated in the most appropriate way possible. Advice can also be provided about how the disease will progress and what complications can be expected. Furthermore other family members can be advised about the risks of inheriting the disease."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Alcohol?,76,"There is no need for people with diabetes to give up alcohol simply because of their diabetes. Although alcohol does have an effect on blood sugar levels with a few precautions and careful management people with diabetes can also enjoy a drink. There are also alcohol substitutes for those who abstain. In fact diabetes alcohol guidelines are the same as for the general population."""
What are the recommended alcohol guidelines for people with diabetes?,77,"The guidelines are two units for women and three units for men. However it is worth being aware how many units a drink contains. In some cases a glass of wine will constitute two units and a pint of beer can even reach three units."""
How much alcohol do drinks usually contain?,78,"If you have diabetes and are wondering how much alcohol you should drink it is worth reading the following list to see how much alcohol is contained in each type of drink. One unit (approximate measure): 1/2 pint of standard strength beer lager or cider pub shot/optic/measure (50ml) of sherry or vermouth 1 pub shot/optic/measure of spirit (25 ml) eg gin vodka or whisky."""
So if I have diabetes I can drink as usual?,79,"Not quite. People with diabetes need to be extra careful with alcohol. Alcohol intake significantly increases the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). If your diabetes is already well under control a moderate amount of alcohol may be fine either before during or soon after a meal. Even if you have a drink this may not influence short-term blood glucose levels. However there are some precautions to be taken care of."""
What do I need to be careful of when it comes to diabetes and alcohol?,80,"Avoid drinking on an empty stomach as this will quickly increase the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream. Also avoid binge-drinking or sustained drinking and never substitute alcohol for your meals. All of this can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Amputation?,81,"Diabetes when present in the body over many years can give rise to all sorts of complications. These include heart disease kidney disease retinopathy and neuropathy. If left untreated some of these complications can become extremely damaging to the body."""
Why is Diabetes is a leading cause of amputation?,82,The NHS reports that people who have diabetes are 15 times more likely to undergo amputations than other people without the condition. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of amputation of the lower limbs throughout the world. Charity Diabetes UK notes that problems of the foot are the most frequent reasons for hospitalisation amongst patients who have diabetes. Many hospital visits due to diabetes-related foot problems are preventable through simple foot care routines. All people who have diabetes should have foot check-ups as a part of their regular care routine.
What factors lead to amputation?,83,"Several key factors usually predispose ulceration and ultimately amputation. These include: Neuropathy Circulation problems Foot ulcers Charcot foot Other damage to the foot."""
How are these factors assessed?,84,"Diabetic foot complications are more common amongst the elderly and amputation rates do increase with age. For people over 75 years old the risk does increase considerably. All people who have diabetes should have a basic education in foot care and beyond this they should have regular foot examinations. The risk for the development of ulceration can be assessed by basic clinical examination of the foot."""
What are major and minor amputations?,85,"Amputations in general not just diabetes-related amputations are classed as major and minor. Minor amputation regards removal of toes or feet. Major amputation refers to the above or below the knee amputation."""
How should I identify a foot at risk from amputation?,86,"Look for any signs of damage to the foot this could be cuts sores burns blisters or ulcers. In people with reduced circulation or sensation in the foot even small damage could be significant."""
What is the purpose of disability benefits?,87,"The aim of disability benefits is to help those people that need it whilst incapacity benefits are intended for those that physically or mentally are unable to work."""
What benefits are available to me?,88,"There are a number of benefits available for people with diabetes and/or their carers: Disability Living Allowance (DLA) Disability Living Allowance is available for people over the age of 16 years old with care and/or mobility needs. For care needs there are three tiers of benefit from needing care for short periods up to care covering both night and day. For mobility needs there are two tiers covering care for those who need guidance and the higher tier for people who find the act of moving around difficult; DLA for parents of children with diabetes: Parents of diabetic children may also claim for disability living allowance if there are significant care needs above those of other children of the same age; Personal Independence Payment (PIP): In 2013 Personal Independence Payment replaced Disability Living Allowance for people between the ages of 16 and 64. For care needs there are two tiers of benefit for both mobility and daily living needs. The tier you may qualify for and therefore how much benefit you receive depends on the extent of care needs you have which is assessed on a points basis. Attendance Allowance for over 65s: If you are over 65 and have specific care needs for safety reasons or to carry out basic tasks you may wish to claim Attendance Allowance. There are two tiers available higher and lower depending on your specific care needs. There are two tiers available a lower tier for day or night needs and a higher tier for day and night needs."""
what are Carbohydrate Controlled Diets?,89,"One area of confusion for diabetics and their diets is carbohydrates. So should you eat carbohydrates or avoid them? Carbohydrates have a direct influence on blood sugar levels and so diets followed by people with diabetes tend to focus either on the quantity of carbohydrate intake or the speed at which carbohydrates are absorbed by the body. In the UK patients diagnosed with diabetes are generally recommended by health professionals to follow a low GI diet rather than a low-carb diet."""
What is a carbohydrate controlled diet?,90,"A carbohydrate controlled diet is a diet in which carbohydrate intake is either limited or set at a particular value. Setting carbohydrate intake at set values or limits can be used by people with diabetes help stabilise blood glucose levels. Examples of carbohydrate controlled diets include: Low carbohydrate diets Ketogenic diets Atkins diet Low carb high fat diet South beach diet The Zone diet."""
what are Fixed carbohydrate intakes?,91,"A diet involving fixed intakes of carbohydrate through the day can help to simply diabetes control and may be helpful to people on insulin and particularly those on fixed dose insulin regimens. Having a fixed intake of carbohydrate each day offers less flexibility in terms of meals but can offer more consistency over blood glucose control. People with type 1 diabetes will still need to have competence in carbohydrate counting."""
what are Restricted carbohydrate diets?,92,"Restricted carbohydrate diets set a limit on how much carbohydrate you take in over the course of a day or for each meal. Low carbohydrate diets are a form of restricted carbohydrate diet. Restricted carbohydrate diets may specify a maximum value of carbohydrate intake. However sometimes this is not needed particularly if the diet suggests avoiding many of the kind of foods with higher carbohydrate intakes."""
How do restricted carbohydrate diets work?,93,"Restricting carbohydrates from a diet can help to reduce hunger particularly in people with diabetes as it can help prevent wider swings in blood glucose levels that can be responsible for causing hunger. If carbohydrate and calorie intake is kept low enough it can help to promote regular ketosis in which the body breaks down fat tissues to convert them into ketones an alternative energy source to glucose. The breaking down of fat is one reason why very low carbohydrate diets can help with weight loss. Whilst restricted carbohydrate diets can help with weight loss they may also be used primarily for maintaining good blood glucose control. If following a low carbohydrate diet an increased intake of fat and protein may be needed to prevent weight loss occurring."""
what is the relation between diabetes and Cholesterol?,94,"High cholesterol levels may be a sign that you are at higher risk of heart disease and stroke. However it is the balance of cholesterol levels that is a better indicator heart health and it is the balance of cholesterol that your doctors should take into account before advising treatment. Lifestyle modifications and statins are commonly used to reduce high cholesterol levels. Whilst cholesterol levels may rise for a number of reasons high cholesterol levels over a period of years is often associated with a greater risk of health problems.Too low cholesterol can be more dangerous than too high cholesterol."""
What is cholesterol?,95,"Cholesterol is a type of blood fat (blood lipid) that forms the membrane of each cell of the body. Cholesterol is carried in the blood by proteins called lipoproteins and it is these that are measured when you have a cholesterol test. These are: High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) LDL is often referred to as ‘bad cholesterol’ because it is this form of cholesterol that can build up in blood vessels. HDL is often referred to as ‘good cholesterol’ because it helps to clear excess LDL out of the blood. Whilst LDL may be called bad cholesterol it is needed for the body and is usually healthy as long as it is kept in balance by a sufficient level of HDL. Triglycerides are another form of blood lipid (blood fat) and are also measured when a cholesterol test is taken. Total cholesterol is the figure of all the different blood fats added together. Ratio of total cholesterol-to-HDL is taken by dividing the total cholesterol figure by the HDL figure. This provides a more reliable indicator of heart health than looking at the total cholesterol or LDL figures."""
what are the Cholesterol targets for people with diabetes?,96,"NICE no longer specifies target cholesterol levels for people with diabetes. Your doctors will use a calculator called QRISK2 to work out your risk of heart disease using a number of factors such as age BMI gender blood pressure levels cholesterol levels and which type of diabetes you have. If you want a general guide of how healthy your cholesterol levels are find out your total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio. To find this take your total cholesterol figure and divide it by your HDL figure. A result of less than four is healthy."""
what are the Symptoms of high cholesterol?,97,"High cholesterol does not usually present any symptoms in itself however people that have high or unbalanced cholesterol levels over a number of years are more likely to develop problems conditions such as heart disease stroke and peripheral arterial disease (PAD)."""
What causes high cholesterol?,98,"High or unhealthy cholesterol levels may be brought on by: High-calorie diet High-carbohydrate diets Low physical activity Obesity Smoking High alcohol intake. High cholesterol levels may also result from the following: Hypothyroidism - an underactive thyroid Kidney disease Liver disease Familial hypercholesterolaemia - a genetic condition that affects around 1 in 500 people."""
how does Diet affect cholesterol?,99,"In the past fat has been blamed for high cholesterol levels and heart disease. Whilst some fatty foods such as chips crisps pizza and pies are unhealthy they are high carbohydrate foods as well as high-fat. If you have healthy fats and follow a low-carb diet you’re likely to have as good or better cholesterol levels and heart health than by following a low-fat diet. Healthy fats are from natural sources and minimally processed such as avocado olive oil unprocessed meat oily fish full fat dairy nuts. As we noted above higher total cholesterol does not necessarily indicate unhealthy cholesterol levels. So when reviewing your cholesterol levels look at the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL. Low-carb and ketogenic diets are particularly good at raising the level of HDL (good) cholesterol. For an easy to follow guide to healthy eating with diabetes join the Low Carb Program."""
how to Diagnose high cholesterol?,100,"A cholesterol test which measures total cholesterol HDL cholesterol non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be performed at least once every year for people with diabetes. It is more difficult to measure LDL cholesterol and so non-HDL cholesterol is used instead of getting a direct LDL measurement."""
how to Treat high cholesterol?,101,"If your cholesterol levels are found to be too high and unhealthily balanced your doctor may advise you to modify your diet and take more physical exercise. They may also offer you statins. Try to cut down on any convenience foods you may be having and have home cooked or home prepared food where possible. Consider using the plate method which is a good way to ensure you’re having appropriate portion sizes and getting enough vegetables. Low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets are effective for getting a healthier balance of cholesterol. If you need help with modifying your diet arrange an appointment with a dietitian. Regular exercise is also recommended. You should aim to dedicate 30 minutes or more to physical activity at least five times a week. If you smoke it is highly beneficial to quit smoking to lower your risk of heart attack or stroke. Statins will often be offered to adults with diabetes and high cholesterol."""
Do I need tablets (statins) for high cholesterol?,102,"NICE generally recommends that people with a 10% or greater risk of developing heart disease within the next 10 years take statins. This likelihood is worked out by the QRISK2 calculator that doctors use. For people with diabetes NICE recommends [150]: Consider statin treatment for all adults with type 1 diabetes offer statins to anyone with type 2 diabetes with a 10% or greater risk of developing heart disease in the next 10 years. The starting dose of statins should be atorvastatin 20 mg unless this is not tolerated by the patient. Statins have been shown to prevent a major heart event in around 1 in 100 people that take the tablets for 3 years. Statins may cause side effects such as aching muscles headaches or memory trouble in some people. If sides effects occur speak to your doctor. If you have side effects from statins they should disappear once you stop taking them. Whether you take statins should be an agreement between you and your doctor and you have the right to accept or turn down the offer to take statins."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Coeliac Disease (Coeliac Sprue or Gluten Allergy)?,103,"Coeliac disease (also known as celiac disease) is a condition that occurs when the lining of the small intestine is damaged by gluten. Gluten has an adverse reaction that causes the immune system to attack the lining of the bowel. Gluten is a common protein that is found in: Rye Wheat and Barley. The damaged lining of the small intestine means that foods are not absorbed properly. Several groups are more at risk from developing celiac disease and these include type 1 diabetics."""
What symptoms are common in coeliac disease?,104,"What symptoms are common in coeliac disease? Like diabetes itself coeliac disease can be diagnosed with no symptoms and the symptoms can be extremely subtle. If symptoms are presented they may include: Abdominal pain or discomfort Abdominal bloating Flatulence Diarrhoea Losing weight from an inability to absorb nutrients from food Feeling excessively tired. Children that are not growing at the expected rate for their age may also be presenting a sign of coeliac disease."""
what is the relation Coeliac disease and children?,105,"In babies and young children coeliac disease can cause them to gain weight become paler and be lethargic and unhappy. In children coeliac disease often starts manifesting itself when cereals are introduced into the diet. All of the symptoms of coeliac disease can also be indicative of other conditions so it is essential to seek professional diagnosis before jumping to any conclusions. However if left untreated coeliac disease can lead to bone disease anaemia and even cancer."""
How large is the risk of coeliac disease in the UK?,106,"Recent research has found that coeliac disease affects approximately 1 in 300 people throughout the UK and Europe. In some areas of the world coeliac disease is more prevalent. For instance the West coast of Ireland has a high coeliac concentration with approximately 1 in 100 people affected by the condition. Coeliac condition occurs equally in men and women."""
What are the causes of coeliac disease?,107,"Gluten is a combination of the proteins gliadin and glutenin. When Gluten is mixed with water it becomes sticky and forms dough. When gluten reaches the lining of the small bowel it causes a reaction. The immune system attacks villi on the lining of the bowel as if it were an external organism. In coeliac disease the villi are attacked and eventually may be destroyed. Henceforth nutrients are not properly absorbed leading to a host of problems. Many coeliacs inherit the condition from a member of their family although having a coeliac family member means only a 10% higher chance of developing the condition."""
Is there a link between diabetes and coeliac disease?,108,"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease meaning that the body’s immune system attacks its own cells. Type 1 diabetes is also an autoimmune disease and research has established a higher incidence of type 1 diabetes diagnosis in people with coeliac disease than in the general population.Type 1 diabetes affects around 0.75% of the UK population whereas it affects between 2% and 10% of people with coeliac disease. The NICE guidelines recommends that people with type 1 diabetes are screened for coeliac disease."""
How will being coeliac affect my diabetes?,109,"If coeliac disease has caused damage to the small intestine this can lead to difficulties with absorbing nutrients including carbohydrate which may lead to an increased likelihood of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels will help you to see how your sugar levels respond to meals and can help to catch instances of too high or too low blood sugar levels."""
What diet should I use if I have coeliac disease and diabetes?,110,"To return the intestine to a normal pre-coeliac state it is necessary to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. Diet is essential to manage diabetes but when combined with coeliac disease this needs careful attention. When coeliac disease has been diagnosed many of the staple sources of carbohydrate such as bread pasta cereal biscuits and cakes must be avoided. However they can be replaced with gluten-free alternatives. The NHS recognises that gluten free alternatives may not be readily available and can be more expensive and so a number of gluten free foods are available on prescription for people with coeliac disease. here are several key difficulties to be considered when combining a coeliac and diabetes-friendly diet. Having both diabetes and coeliac disease can significantly reduce the number of foods available to eat. As many pre-prepared foods rely on gluten you may need to prepare more foods from scratch. There are many books available about living gluten-free."""

how is Diabetes and Dental Health related?,112,"Problems with teeth and gums can be more common for people with diabetes so good dental health is important to prevent dental complications developing. Looking after your teeth and gums is an essential part of learning to live with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.You should inform your dentist if you have either new-onset or long-standing diabetes as this might affect your dental treatment and how often they must review your teeth and gums."""
how is Diabetes and dental hygiene related?,113,"People with diabetes who have poor control of their blood glucose levels are more likely to develop dental health problems. Therefore keeping your blood sugar within a normal range will reduce this risk. Eating a balanced diet getting regular exercise and giving up smoking is also advised to lessen the risk of oral health problems. Making sure that you visit a dentist every six months ensures that any infection will be treated as early as possible. Minor dental problems can quickly escalate and a routine visit to the dentist will pick up on these. In the UK although people with diabetes are more prone to dental problems they do not receive any extra financial help for dental treatment."""
how is Diabetes and gum diseases related?,114,"Having prolonged high blood glucose levels can increase the risk of oral health problems such as gum disease. Gum disease also known as periodontitis is the sixth most common disease in the world. It occurs when bacteria within the mouth begins to form into a sticky plaque which sits on the surface of the tooth. Gum disease is classified on the severity of its development. There are three stages of gum disease: Gingivitis: Gingivitis is the initial stage of gum disease caused by poor oral hygiene and irregular plaque removal from teeth. It is characterised by swollen red and tender gums and it can cause bleeding when brushing. Luckily gingivitis is reversible and through improving your oral hygiene techniques and visiting your dentist or hygienist for advice on a home dental health care program you should be able to reverse this process. Periodontitis (Mild): Untreated gingivitis can lead to mild periodontitis. The conversion of gingivitis to periodontics is more common in people who have a family history of gum disease poor oral hygiene and uncontrolled diabetes. At this stage there will be damage to the gums and bone supporting the teeth. In order to prevent further damage a prompt visit to the dentist is required to prevent further progression. Periodontitis (Severe): This is the most advanced stage of gum disease characterised by significant tissue and bone loss around the teeth. Having prolonged high blood glucose levels can lead to gum disease developing or worsening more quickly but keeping your levels within a normal range reduces the risk of infection spreading. Unfortunately when your body begins to fight an infection blood glucose levels will usually rise in response. Should the infection in your mouth become worse you could have problems with food intake which might affect your diabetes management. Your dentist can help you with your diabetes if you have developed gum disease or another mouth infection."""
What are the symptoms of dental health problems?,115,"Sore or swollen gums Bleeding gums Receding gums Loose teeth Bad breath. You should visit your dentist if you experience any of these symptoms; urgent treatment might be required to prevent a problem from worsening."""
How could Dental treatment affect blood sugar levels?,116,"If dental work requires you to take special precautions (such as not eating for a short period) you should ensure that this won’t affect your treatment regime. If you are on medication that can lead to hypos such as insulin or sulphonylureas speak with your dentist or your doctor to see if your medication will need to be modified before the dental work. High blood sugar levels may affect the time the teeth and gums take to heal. If dental work is taking an unusually long time to heal you should immediately contact your diabetes healthcare team or dentist for advice."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Depression?,117,"According to NICE people who are diagnosed with a chronic physical health problem such as diabetes are 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression than people without it. Depression can have a serious impact on a person’s well being and their ability and motivation to self-manage their condition. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder witnessed in the diabetes community. People with diabetes suffering from depression are at greater risk of suffering from an episode of diabetic burnout which collectively can have adverse effects on physical health and potentially instigate more long term complications both to do with diabetes and independent from the condition."""
What exactly is depression?,118,"Depression is the term given when an individual experiences a number of symptoms including: Persistent sadness or anxiety a feeling of hollowness An overriding feeling of hopelessness and negativity Feeling helpless and powerless to change your situation Loss of interest in activities or pleasures Lower energy and increased fatigue Insomnia oversleeping awakening early in the morning Concentration problems memory problems and indecisiveness Dwelling on death or suicide Restlessness Weight change and decreased or increased appetite A diagnosis of depression is made if many of these symptoms are present continuously for a minimum of two weeks. For people with diabetes dealing with a lifelong condition and managing the risk of complications can seem like an overwhelming task particularly for newly diagnosed patients. Many diabetics struggle to cope with the requirements feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated. If diabetes is not faced with an attitude of perseverance and defiance often depression will prevail. Depression is the perception of life situations as undesirable. Often when individuals are faced with adverse events or conditions they spend huge amounts of effort trying to escape or deny such circumstances. Avoiding unpleasantness and expending energy trying to minimize discomfort can cause symptoms of depression."""
How can depression affect my diabetes?,119,"Depression can affect a patient’s capacity to deal with their diabetes including managing blood glucose levels appropriately. Research has found that people who suffer from both diabetes and depression have poorer metabolic and glycemic control which has in turn been found to intensify symptoms of depression. Additionally anti-depressants have been found to have hypoglycaemic effects causing serious problems for self-management. It has previously been reported that depressed people with diabetes are less likely to adherence to medication and diet regimens and subsequently have a reduction in quality of life and increased health care expenditure. Research has shown by addressing depression glycemic control is enhanced mood and quality of life is significantly improved."""
what is Diabulimia?,120,"Although not yet officially recognised as a medical condition diabulimia is nevertheless a serious and emerging problem that can bring on rapid development of diabetes complications. Experts predict that as many as one-third of young female diabetics could be suffering as a result of this condition. Diabulimia is more common in females but is recognised as occurring in significant numbers of young males as well."""
What are the signs of diabulimia?,121,"Signs of diabulimia may include: Regular changes in weight Awkwardness over questions about diabetes control or injections Avoiding clinic appointments Having a high HbA1c compared with results entered in a blood glucose diary Skipping injections will cause blood glucose levels to rise too high and therefore the following signs of hyperglycemia may be recognized:Being very thirsty Needing to urinate frequently Being abnormally tired in the day Having blurred vision."""
How does diabulimia work?,122,"Diabetics who are reliant on insulin find that it is a storage hormone and promotes fat. If patients miss injections or manipulate dosage they could theoretically reduce weight. Diabetics can continue to manage their disease but neither safely nor effectively. Diabetic patients could avoid ketoacidosis and obvious signs of management failure without realising the extent of damage that they are causing."""
How does diabulimia affect the body?,123,"The side effects of manipulating and omitting insulin from the body can be serious and dangerous both in the short term and the long term. Blood sugar levels can surge and reach an unhealthy level leading to: Fatigue Dehydration Wearing of the muscle tissue and A much greater risk of ketoacidosis which can be immediately dangerous. In the medium to long term the risk of suffering complications such as retinopathy neuropathy and kidney disease is greatly increased. It is not uncommon for teenagers with diabulimia to develop complications within their twenties."""
Will I lose my job if my diabetes causes me to have too much time off work?,124,"If your employer has a set number of sick days and your diabetes or another disability causes you to exceed the maximum number your employer should take reasonable steps to accommodate for this. If your time off work can be reasonably accommodated by your employer you should not lose your job. If absences are affecting the business in a way that cannot be accommodated dismissal may be deemed fair. If your diabetes has lead you to be off work for a long time and you are unlikely to return to work soon an employer could be acting within their rights if they choose to terminate your position.

Do I need to inform the DVLA for my diabetes?,126,"If you don’t tell the DVLA about your diabetes or any other medical conditions that affect your driving when you should you can be fined up to £1 000 and could even be prosecuted if you are involved in an accident as a result. For all If any of the following factors apply you must inform the DVLA: If you have suffered more than one episode of severe hypoglycemia within the last 12 months (driving cars or motorcycles only) If you have suffered any episode of severe hypoglycaemia within the last 12 months (buses coaches or lorries) If you experience severe hypoglycemia whilst driving If you lose awareness of hypoglycemia If you have visual impairment in both your eyes or in one eye if it is your only fully functioning eye If you need to have laser treatment in both your eyes or in one eye if it is the only fully functioning eye If you have poor blood circulation or loss of sensation (such as caused by neuropathy) that means you need to drive only particular types of vehicles such as those with automatic gearboxes or with hand operated accelerators or brakes If you develop a complication of diabetes or any other medical condition that affects your ability to drive safely."""
what the relationship between Diabetes and Employment?,127,"For a start in almost all situations you should disclose your diabetes if your employment application requires you to. In all but a few rare cases there is no reason why people with diabetes should not have equal access to jobs; the exceptions being when employers for some positions may be unwilling to accept employees who are at risk of hypoglycemia."""
Are some jobs more suitable for people with diabetes?,128,"This depends entirely on each individual looking for a job.Some professions may be more suitable depending on your diabetes control and also advice from your healthcare professionals. For instance some people with diabetes may wish to do more physical exercise rather than be at a desk all day but obviously there is a balance to be struck and good blood glucose control might be essential for a role like this. Similarly many people with a good blood sugar routine may prefer fixed working hours in order to maintain their stability. Some people with diabetes seeking a job will also look for the freedom to inject insulin or test their blood glucose whilst at work."""
Are diabetics banned from doing some jobs?,129,"This depends on your type of diabetes and how you control it. Thankfully very few professions remain completely out of bounds for people with diabetes. No matter what profession you are seeking to undertake it is worth checking the suitability of the role both with the prospective employer and with your healthcare professional."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Ethnicity?,130,"Global studies on ethnic groups and minorities and the rising incidence of diabetes have revealed one factor in particular; ethnicity can increase or decrease one’s risk of developing diabetes. Whilst in some cases this can be explained by access to healthcare and other socio-economic factors studies have proved that even with equal access prevalence of diabetes differs between people of different ethnicity."""
what are interesting Ethnicity facts of diabetes?,131,"Type 2 diabetes is up to 6 times more likely in people of South Asian descent Type 2 diabetes is up to three times more likely in African and Africa-Caribbean people Furthermore diabetes affects different ethnic groups in different ways."""
how is Diabetes in India and China?,132,"Although India and China are currently regarded as being the diabetes capitals of the world to gain an appreciation of the variation of diabetes prevalence between different ethnic groups the USA provides a valid model for study. The USA houses an enormously diverse ethnic mix. The National Health Interview Survey is one of the most comprehensive studies to date. In the USA according to results from the study it appears that black and Hispanic people are more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Furthermore American Indians and Natives of Alaska are apparently more likely than any other minority to develop diabetes. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have also been found to be significantly more at risk of developing diabetes than non-Hispanic whites."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Extreme Sports?,133,"The nature of diabetes does not typically lend itself to taking part in extreme sports and activities. Short-term complications attributed to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mean that risk inherent in extreme sports are even more risky for diabetics. The influence that high or low blood sugar levels can have on the body may prohibit some diabetics from taking part in extreme sports but this is not always the case."""
What are extreme sports?,134,"Extreme sports include high-risk activities such as rock climbing paragliding parachuting scuba diving and surfing. Although all of these sports may not necessarily fit into the popular definition of extreme sports for the purposes of diabetic involvement they may be considered as a group."""
Why shouldn’t diabetics take part in extreme sports?,135,"Diabetes needn’t necessarily prevent individuals participating in extreme sports. However sports that require a high level of fitness and provoke an adrenaline-based reaction of extreme excitement might not suit all diabetics and should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor or medical healthcare professional. People taking certain medication such as insulin may find themselves excluded from certain sports such as scuba diving. In this case it is the organiser’s responsibility and therefore their decision."""
What should diabetics wishing to participate in extreme sports do?,136,"Diabetic patients wishing to participate in extreme sports should following the go-ahead from doctors or healthcare participants evaluate exactly how the activity will affect their blood sugar levels and prepare for this reaction by packing testing equipment insulin/medication food and water."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and Fitness?,137,"Knowing that you have to exercise and how to actually do it are two different things. The type level and duration of physical activity that you undertake as a diabetic will depend on what is suitable for you something you should agree with your doctor or healthcare team. We are developing our Fitness and Exercise area to encompass the information any diabetic would want to know about sports fitness and exercise in relation to diabetes."""
what does Fitness and Exercise Guides do?,138,"The fitness and exercise guides look at keeping active how sports can affect your blood sugar and how to prevent hypoglycemia during physical activity."""
What is the best kind of physical activity to help prevent or manage diabetes?,139,"The best type of physical activity will depend on your individual situation. Generally aerobic exercise strength training and flexibility training should be combined to form a comprehensive exercise routine."""
what is Seize the moment?,140,"As well as doing consistent suitable exercise being active throughout the whole day can help to burn calories. This means seizing the moment and burning as many calories as possible. For instance using a bike or walking rather than driving doing garden or household chores and setting yourself small physical challenges can all be helpful."""
What problems can hot weather cause for people with diabetes?,141,"Dehydration can be an issue in hot weather and higher blood glucose levels can further increase this risk. People with diabetes may need to increase their intake of fluids in hot weather drinking water regularly through the day. One of the major concerns regarding diabetes and hot weather is the risk of blood sugar levels rising or falling and causing hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia."""
What are the hypo risks from hot weather?,142,"Hot weather can increase the risk of hypoglycemia for those on blood glucose lowering medication. The Joslin Diabetes Centre notes that the body’s metabolism is higher in hot and humid weather which can lead to an increased chance of hypoglycemia. Hypos may be slightly harder to spot in hot weather. Don’t be tempted to disregard hypo symptoms such as sweating and tiredness as a result of hot weather as it could be a sign of hypoglycemia. Take extra care when driving and test your blood sugar before and after each journey and stop regularly to check your blood sugar if taking longer journeys. To prevent hypos be prepared to test your blood glucose more often particularly if taking part in physical activity in hot weather. Keep a source of fasting carbohydrate such as glucose tablets to hand. To help treat hypos buy glucose products from the Diabetes Shop. You may need to adjust your insulin levels during changes in temperature. If you are experiencing higher or lower blood sugar levels and need advice about adjusting your insulin levels speak with a member of your healthcare team."""
What is hyperglycemia?,143,"Hyperglycemia the term for expressing high blood sugar has been defined by the World Health Organisation as: Blood glucose levels greater than 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) when fasting Blood glucose levels greater than 11.0 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) 2 hours after meals. Although blood sugar levels exceeding 7 mmol/L for extended periods of time can start to cause damage to internal organs symptoms may not develop until blood glucose levels exceed 11 mmol/L."""
What causes hyperglycemia?,144,"The underlying cause of hyperglycemia will usually be from loss of insulin producing cells in the pancreas or if the body develops resistance to insulin. More immediate reasons for hyperglycemia include: Missing a dose of diabetic medication tablets or insulin Eating more carbohydrates than your body and/or medication can manage Being mentally or emotionally stressed (injury surgery or anxiety) Contracting an infection."""
What are the symptoms of hyperglycemia?,145,"The main 3 symptoms of high blood sugar levels are increased urination increased thirst and increased hunger. High blood sugar levels can also contribute to the following symptoms: Regular/above-average urination Weakness or feeling tired Loss of weight Increased thirst Vision blurring."""
Is hyperglycemia serious?,146,"Hyperglycemia can be serious if: Blood glucose levels stay high for extended periods of time - this can lead to the development of long term complications Blood glucose levels rise dangerously high - this can lead to short term complications."""
How to avoid and deal with hyperglycemia?,147,"Minimising long time exposure to high blood sugar levels is one of the key objectives of diabetes control. Testing blood sugar levels will help in managing hyperglycemia. People who take insulin may be able to take additional insulin. However only take additional insulin if your doctor is happy for you to do so as miscalculations could lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels. Diabetes UK advise people with type 1 diabetes to test for ketones if blood glucose levels rise above 15 mmol/l or the signs of ketoacidosis appear. Contact your health team if high levels of ketones are present. If blood glucose levels remain high for long periods of time contact your health team for advice."""
How does illness affect diabetes?,148,"During an illness or infection the body will release extra glucose into your blood stream in a bid to help combat the illness. In people without diabetes this is an effective strategy as their pancreas will release extra insulin to cope with the extra blood glucose. In people with diabetes though the release of glucose presents an unwanted extra difficulty in managing the rise in blood glucose levels - in addition to feeling less than 100%."""
Which injection site is best?,149,"Each of the four key injection sites are different and the rate at which insulin is absorbed will differ depending on which one used. A general rule of thumb is that the stomach gets insulin to the blood most quickly whilst the bum is the slowest route."""
What else affects how fast insulin enters the blood?,150,"For diabetics that inject insulin injecting an area about to be used in physical activity (even if it is relatively minor such as sustained typing) can mean the rate of absorption is much quicker. Similarly a hot day can speed up the action of insulin. At any time if you are unsure how quickly your insulin is being absorbed check your blood glucose levels to make sure."""
What are ketones?,151,"Ketones are an acid remaining when the body burns its own fat. When the body has insufficient insulin it cannot get glucose from the blood into the body’s cells to use as energy and will instead begin to burn fat. The liver converts fatty acids into ketones which are then released into the bloodstream for use as energy. It is normal to have a low level of ketones as ketones will be produced whenever body fat is burned. In people that are insulin dependent such as people with type 1 diabetes however high levels of ketones in the blood can result from taking too little insulin and this can lead to a particularly dangerous condition known as ketoacidosis."""
How do I test for ketones?,152,"Ketone testing can be carried out at home. The most accurate way of testing for ketones is to use a blood glucose meter which can test for ketones as well as blood glucose levels. You can also test urine for ketone levels however the testing of urine means that the level you get is representative of your ketone levels up to a few hours ago."""
Who needs to be aware of ketones?,153,"The following people with diabetes should be aware of ketones and the symptoms of ketoacidosis: Anyone dependent on insulin – such as all people with type 1 diabetes People with type 2 diabetes that are taking SGLT2 inhibitors (such as Forxiga Invokana and Jardiance). It is essential to know what the symptoms are and when you should test for ketones. Finding high levels of ketones present in your urine is a sign that the management of your diabetes needs adjusting. Ketone testing will be important within pregnancy for anyone with diabetes on insulin. Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes that is not treated with insulin should contact their health team if experiencing the symptoms of ketoacidosis."""
Will I be able to lead a ‘normal’  life?,154,"There is nothing stopping you leading a normal life. However it is paramount that you take good control of your diabetes to ensure you can lead a healthy long life. Diabetes can affect all areas of your life. You may wish to explore how diabetes can affect: Blood glucose levels Driving Getting a job Emotions Travel Sex. If you have any questions don’ t forget you can ask the community over in the Diabetes Forum."""
What are the risk factors for metabolic syndrome?,155,"The set of risk factors for metabolic syndrome generally include: Obesity - generally in the abdominal region. Outwardly this is manifested as excess fat tissue in and around the abdomen of the person Insulin resistance or intolerance to glucose - this means that the body cannot properly use blood sugar or insulin Proinflammatory state - higher amounts of C-reactive protein in the blood Prothrombotic state - higher amounts of fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 present in the bloodstream Atherogenic Dyslipidemia - disorders in the blood fat with high levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol and low levels of ‘good’ cholesterol Higher blood pressure People who suffer from metabolic syndrome are at a much greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes as well as other diseases."""
What are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome?,156,"You may recognise some of the following symptoms of metabolic syndrome: Tiredness - particularly after meals Inability to focus properly - ‘brain fog’ Acanthosis nigricans - browning (hyperpigmentation) of folds of skin such as on the neck armpits groin and between the buttocks Most commonly patients suffering from metabolic syndrome will exhibit two major symptoms: Abdominal obesity Resistance to insulin."""
What if I have some of these symptoms?,157,"If you have a any of these symptoms your doctor can run tests to determine whether you have elevated blood sugar levels and therefore insulin resistance. One of these is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT or GTT)."""
What is metabolism?,158,"Metabolism refers to the chemical reactions that take place inside the cells of living organisms which are essential for life. For the purposes of this guide metabolism refers to the processes that occur in the body once food is eaten."""
How does insulin resistance lead to higher blood sugar levels?,159,"If insulin resistance exists this therefore reduces the effectiveness of the phase 1 insulin response (as discussed in non-diabetics). The pancreas will release all the insulin it has but it likely won’t be enough because the insulin is less effective. To cope with this the body has to rely on its phase 2 insulin response however this takes some time and therefore in that time without sufficient insulin available blood sugar levels in the type 2 diabetic or pre-diabetic are very likely to rise higher than normal. If the next meal is sufficiently far away the body may have time to catch up and produce enough new (phase 2) insulin to catch up and bring blood sugar levels back to normal. However as mentioned above 1 this therefore further slows down the production capability of insulin which helps to escalate the problem further. If the diabetic or pre-diabetic is used to consuming relatively generous amounts of carbohydrates then the effects of the problem are exaggerated further. Note also that higher sugar levels tend to make people feel both lethargic and more hungry as the less effective insulin means they are less able to get glucose into the cells which need the energy. If a larger amount of food is eaten as a result then the excess calories will start to get absorbed as additional body fat which may contribute to further insulin resistance."""
What is nocturia?,160,Nocturia is defined as nocturnal urination. This means the need to get up in the night to go to the toilet. Needing to go to the toilet up to once during the night is considered to be normal. Needing to urinate more than once during the night could indicate a temporary or longer term problem may be present.
what are the Causes of nocturia?,161,"There are a number of possible causes for needing to urinate more frequently than normal at night and these may include one or more of the following: Diabetes insipidus High blood glucose levels Autonomic neuropathy Urinary tract infections Cystitis Prostate diseases Pregnancy Excessive fluid intake - particularly alcohol or caffeine intake Taking diuretic medications Parkinson’s disease Multiple sclerosis. Nocturia is more likely to appear as we get older."""
what is the relation between Diabetes and nocturia?,162,"Having high blood glucose levels can cause the body to excrete excess glucose via the urine. In this instance more sugar appears in the urine and simulates extra volumes of urine to be produced. If you regularly have high blood glucose levels you may increase the risk of picking up a urinary tract infection which can also increase the need to urinate through the night. One specific form of diabetes that is not linked with abnormal blood glucose levels diabetes insipidus is closely linked with nocturia."""
How can nocturia be treated?,163,"How nocturia is treated will depend upon what the underlying cause is. If you are having than recommended blood glucose levels bringing your levels under tighter control could help to reduce the need to urinate at night. Contact your GP or diabetes team for help in improving your blood glucose control. If nocturia becomes troublesome or more frequent than normal speak to your GP a sign of a condition unrelated to diabetes. In some cases your doctor may prescribe medication to help reduce the frequency of urination over night. Diuretic medication may be prescribed for use earlier in the day to help you pass excess urine before going to sleep."""
what are the Links between obesity and type 2 diabetes?,164,"While the exact causes of diabetes are still not fully understood it is known that factors up the risk of developing different types of diabetes mellitus. For type 2 diabetes this includes being overweight or obese (having a body mass index - BMI - of 30 or greater). In fact obesity is believed to account for 80-85% of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes while recent research suggests that obese people are up to 80 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with a BMI of less than 22."""
How does obesity cause type 2 diabetes?,165,"It is a well-known fact that if you are overweight or obese you are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes particularly if you have excess weight around your tummy (abdomen)."""
how to Make lifestyle changes?,166,"Making healthy lifestyle changes can often prevent obesity and in order to avoid a healthcare crisis the UK needs to spread information that highlights the importance of doing just that especially amongst children."""
what is the relation between Pregnancy and Diabetes?,167,"It is estimated that between 2% and 3% percent of pregnant women are affected by gestational diabetes during pregnancy. If the mother’s body cannot produce sufficient insulin to overcome this diabetes in pregnancy can develop."""
How does smoking increase my heart disease risk as a diabetic?,168,"Smoking and diabetes both increase the risk of heart disease in very similar ways and so when combined they greatly exacerbate the chances of suffering a heart related condition such as a heart attack or stroke. Both high levels of glucose in the blood and smoking damage the walls of the arteries in such a way that fatty deposits can build up much easier. As this occurs the blood vessels narrow and make circulating blood much harder. When this happens to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood and therefore oxygen) a heart attack can occur. Similarly a stroke is when not enough blood can get to the brain and so anything that may limit blood flow increases the risks of a stroke. High blood glucose levels also have this effect on the blood vessels and blood flow so if you smoke when you have diabetes you are putting yourself at a much greater risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke."""
What other diabetes complications will smoking affect?,169,"Further diabetes complications that have been proven to be aggravated by smoking include diabetic nephropathy albuminuria. There are links between smoking and retinopathy although these are less evident than the cardiovascular risks. Smoking is certainly a major risk factor for both the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy."""
What benefits could giving up smoking give to me as a diabetic?,170,Stopping smoking reduces the risk of developing a major diabetes-related complication. Many diabetics do not stop because of concerns over weight gain. Some studies have proved that the benefits of giving up smoking as a diabetic actually outweigh any negative effects caused by weight gain.
What are stem cells?,171,"Stem cells are a form of cell that is yet to develop a specific set of traits. However what stem cells have in abundance is the potential to develop into a number of different forms."""
What is stem cell research?,172,"Stem cell research covers the scientific study of these stem cells. Stem cell research allows researchers to grow specific varieties of human cells in the lab and research how they behave and interact under different conditions. Stem cells open up a wide spectrum of diabetes research possibilities. In one example of diabetes stem cell research researchers took cells from human intestine cells and disabled a gene which enabled the cells to produce insulin."""
Where do stem cells come from?,173,"Stem cells for the treatment of diabetes are able to come from a variety of sources. These include foetal tissue from: Embryos The placenta Umbilical cord Bone marrow Blood cells Teeth."""
how is Stem cells use in islet cell transplants?,174,"To cure type 1 diabetes stem cell replacement needs to be more than simply a case of swapping insulin-producing cells from a healthy pancreas with those destroyed by diabetes in a diabetic patient. Numerous complications preclude this as a simple treatment. Islet cell transplants are one form of procedure that has proven effective. In type 1 diabetes the body’s immune system becomes programmed to attack the beta cells so the patient must take immuno-suppressant drugs to prevent this happening. In the future it may be possible to grow islet cells from patient’s existing islet cells however a patient with type 1 diabetes would still need immune suppressants to prevent the cells being destroyed."""
What are the differences in diagnosing diabetes amongst the elderly when compared to diabetes amongst the young?,175,"There are numerous physiological changes underway as our bodies grow and adapt to their age. Elderly people who are at risk of developing diabetes or who have already developed the disease may not exhibit the classic symptoms expected. Age-related changes can mean that some symptoms will be masked or harder to spot."""
What are the differences in treatment of diabetes amongst the elderly when compared to diabetes amongst the young?,176,Treating diabetes amongst the elderly can present unique challenges. Other disabilities associated with aging can contribute to the complexity of strictly self-managing diabetes. Impaired physical functioning amongst some elderly patients can mean that adjusting to a diabetes care routine is more difficult. Cognitive impairment can also provide an obstacle.
Are there increased risks when an elderly person develops diabetes?,177,"Elderly people are often more frail and susceptible to illness. This can mean diabetes-related complications are more common and harder to manage. Furthermore exercise and adapting a diet can be more difficult for elderly people and problems can arise in these areas. All diabetes complications can occur amongst older patients. Cognitive complications are more common amongst the elderly. Further problems may include undiagnosed depression social issues limited daily means and coexisting health problems. Many elderly diabetic patients are pre-disposed to hypoglycemia."""

What healthy changes should I encourage my relative to make?,182,"If you and your relative share meal times make sure that they eat the same healthy food that you do. Try not to buy any types of food that he or she shouldn’t eat. Diabetics need to stay aware of their diet and if you understand a healthy diabetic diet this can be all the easier to communicate to your relative. Exercise is another fundamental part of diabetes management. Relatives can make exercising easier by agreeing to exercise together although each diabetic should speak to their healthcare adviser in order to find out what type of exercise will suit their condition."""
What else can I do to help the diabetic or diabetics in my family?,183,"Knowledge is power here and if you can learn how to recognise any signs of problems you could be a genuine help.The symptoms of high and low blood sugar levels are the place to start. You can also help by understanding the condition. For instance if your relative seems more irritable than usual it could be down to a blood sugar level change."""

what are the Causes of Diabetes?,192,"Diabetes causes vary depending on your genetic makeup family history ethnicity health and environmental factors. There is no common diabetes cause that fits every type of diabetes. The reason there is no defined diabetes cause is because the causes of diabetes vary depending on the individual and the type. For instance; the causes of type 1 diabetes vary considerably from the causes of gestational diabetes. Similarly the causes of type 2 diabetes are distinct from the causes of type 1 diabetes. """
what are Type 1 diabetes causes?,193,"Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system destroying the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. This causes diabetes by leaving the body without enough insulin to function normally. This is called an autoimmune reaction or autoimmune cause because the body is attacking itself. There is no specific diabetes causes but the following triggers may be involved: Viral or bacterial infection Chemical toxins within food Unidentified component causing autoimmune reaction. Underlying genetic disposition may also be a type 1 diabetes cause."""
what are Type 2 diabetes causes?,194,"Type 2 diabetes causes are usually multifactorial - more than one diabetes cause is involved. Often the most overwhelming factor is a family history of type 2 diabetes. This is the most likely type 2 diabetes cause. There are a variety of risk factors for type 2 diabetes any or all of which increase the chances of developing the condition. These include: Obesity Living a sedentary lifestyle Increasing age Bad diet. Other type 2 diabetes causes such as pregnancy or illness can be type 2 diabetes risk factors."""
what are Other diabetes causes?,195,"There are a variety of other potential diabetes causes. These include the following: Pancreatitis or pancreatectomy as a cause of diabetes. Pancreatitis is known to increase the risk of developing diabetes as is a pancreatectomy. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). One of the root causes of PCOS is obesity-linked insulin resistance which may also increase the risk of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Cushing’s syndrome. This syndrome increases production of the cortisol hormone which serves to increased blood glucose levels. An over-abundance of cortisol can cause diabetes. Glucagonoma. Patients with glucagonoma may experience diabetes because of a lack of equilibrium between levels of insulin production and glucagon production. Steroid induced diabetes (steroid diabetes) is a rare form of diabetes that occurs due to prolonged use of glucocorticoid therapy."""

what are the Symptoms of charcot foot?,197,"Symptoms of Charcot foot may include: Swelling or redness of the foot or ankle Skin feeling warmer at the point of injury A deep aching feeling Deformation of the foot People with diabetes should report any signs of foot damage to their doctor as soon as possible as they can develop and become much more serious as a result of neuropathy. More serious foot conditions can result in amputation if not treated by a doctor or specialist."""
what are the Causes of charcot foot?,198,"Charcot foot typically develops over a period of time and requires a number of factors to occur. People with neuropathy have diminished feeling in their feet and may also have reduced muscle control as a result of motor neuropathy. Both of these factors can increase the risk of developing Charcot foot. The trigger for Charcot foot can be a sprain or twisted ankle that goes unnoticed because of reduced feeling from nerve damage. If the person continues to place pressure on the foot through walking the injury can worsen and could lead to dislocation or fractures in one or more bones of the foot or ankle."""
what are the Treatment for charcot foot?,199,Charcot foot is treated by reducing pressure on the foot and wearing a plaster cast to allow the foot to set and heal in the correct position. Whilst your foot is healing you will need regular appointments with a podiatrist and x-rays.
what to do when Recovering from charcot foot?,200,"Whilst the affected foot is recovering check your other foot for any signs of damage or strain as this foot is likely to be taking more pressure whilst the affected foot heals.

Education should include weight guidance testing blood sugar and how to look after your feet and eyes."""
What is stress?,203,"Simply out stress is a state of emotional strain or tension that occurs when we feel that we can’t cope with pressure. When we become stressed the body quickly responds by releasing hormones that give cells access to stored energy - fat and glucose - to help the body get away from danger. This instinctive physiological response to perceived threats is known as the """"fight-freeze or flight"""" response. Over time both physical and mental stress can wear us down mentally and lead to depression and other mental health issues."""
What can cause stress?,204,"We live in a very stressful society which is constantly putting us under pressure. This pressure can sometimes be too much to handle leading us to feel """"stressed out"""". This everyday feeling can be caused by simple things such as: Work Pressure Marriage and relationships Parenting/children Health problems such as diabetes Financial insecurity Traffic."""
How does stress affect my diabetes?,205,"It is widely recognised that people with diabetes are who regularly stressed are more likely to have poor blood glucose control. One of the reasons for this is that stress hormones such as cortisol increase the amount of sugar in our blood. High levels of cortisol can lead to conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome which is one of the lesser known causes of diabetes. Constant stress and frustration caused by long term problems with blood glucose regulation can also wear people down and cause them to neglect their diabetes care. For example they may start to ignore their blood sugar levels or simply forget to check them or they may adopt poor lifestyle habits such as exercising less eating more ‘junk’ and processed foods drinking more alcohol and smoking. This is known as diabetes burnout. While stress alters blood sugar levels the extent of its impact varies from person to person. Studies into the effects of stress on glucose levels in humans have shown that mental or psychological stress causes a rise in glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes and in most type 1 diabetics although levels can drop in some individuals with type 1. Physical stress such as illness or injury almost always causes blood sugar levels to elevate in people with either type of diabetes."""
How do I know whether stress is affecting my glycemic control?,206,"A simple way to do this is to rate your stress level on a scale of 1 to 10 every time you test your blood sugar levels. Make a note of this number and next to it write down your glucose reading. By doing this consistently for a few weeks a pattern should emerge that allows you to see whether high levels of stress coincide with high glucose levels or vice versa."""
What is the fight-freeze or flight response?,207,"The fight-freeze or flight response is an evolutionary coping mechanism enabling us to deal with threats and stressful situations. When confronted by a threat hormones are released that help us get ready to either fight the threat or fuel a quick escape. There is an increase in glucose for energy increased blood pressure to take fresh oxygen to working muscles and the release of adrenalin for heightened vigilance and alertness. The """"freeze"""" factor has been introduced in recent years as theories have been put forward as to why people sometimes """"freeze"""" in a hopeless shocking situation. It is possible that this ‘rabbit in headlights’ reaction is similar to playing dead which could have helped our ancestors avoid attacks in the wild. Modern humans have fewer physical threats but when faced with psychological pressures such as getting stuck in traffic the brain and body still behaves in the same manner as when faced with a physical threat (i.e. the fight-freeze or flight response). However in people with diabetes this instinctive response does not work as well. Insulin is needed to get stored energy (glucose) into the body’s cells. But in people who have diabetes this process is hampered as insulin is either not produced (as with type 1 diabetes) or not used effectively (type 2 diabetes) resulting in the build-up of excess glucose in the bloodstream."""
How can I combat stress?,208,"There are a number of ways you can alleviate the feelings of stress. These include: Taking regular exercise or joining a sports team Going on holiday Listening to music Practicing yoga and breathing exercises Mindfulness meditation. The ultimate aim of these exercises/activities is relaxation which is key to controlling stress."""
How does exercise help with stress?,209,"Research studies including one from Maastricht University in 2000 show that physical activity can increase insulin sensitivity and help to lower blood glucose levels as well as burn calories. In the UK the NHS advise to build up to 150 minutes of aerobic activity such as jogging or brisk walking each week. Moving your body through a wide range of motions can also give the mind a rest from the pressures of everyday life. Some people find this relaxing as the mind is preoccupied with exercising rather than worrying about any problems in life."""
How does mindfulness meditation alleviate stress?,210,"Mindfulness meditation is the art of becoming aware of our present moment experiences including thoughts emotions and sensations in a non-judgemental and accepting manner. Mindfulness meditation courses have been shown to significantly reduce stress anxiety and panic attacks in people who are diagnosed with chronic stress and anxiety disorders such as Seasonal Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Specifically research studies have also shown that mindfulness can help people who have diabetes improve their blood glucose control reduce their blood pressure and enhance their overall quality of life. The research suggests that by simply accepting or acknowledging destructive emotions in a non-judgemental way as opposed to suppressing them or trying to change them people with diabetes are able to better regulate their blood glucose levels and cope with the mental strain of constantly treating themselves."""
What is a diabetes screening test?,211,"A screening test determines whether a person has diabetes and how serious it is. Depending on where you are and what your circumstances are the screening test will vary. Random blood glucose tests - commonly used to test for type 1 diabetes Urine glucose test Fasting plasma glucose tests (FPG tests) HbA1c test Oral glucose tolerance tests.Additional diagnostic tests such as urine ketone tests GAD autoantibodies tests or C-peptide tests may also be used as part of the diagnosis to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For adults aged between 40 and 50 screening should be considered. For people who have higher risk factors (ethnicity family history obesity) screening should be conducted beforehand. Measuring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can help diagnose cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. According to diagnostic guidelines set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO) a HbA1c value of: 6% (below 42 mmol/mol) is considered non-diabetic 6-6.4% (42 to 47 mmol/mol) indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation and is considered prediabetes 6.5% or more (48 mmol/mol and above) indicates the presence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes screening is strongly recommended for adults aged between 40 and 50 years or earlier for any adults with one or more risk factors (ethnicity family history obesity etc)."""

The mode of action of sulphonylureas means that hypoglycemia and weight gain can be relatively common side effects."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are Meglitinides / Prandial glucose regulator / Glinides?,219,"The glinides are a class of drug which have a similar response as sulphonylureas but act for a shorter time. Meglitinides are prescribed to be taken by people with type 2 diabetes within half an hour before eating. As the drugs act for a shorter period than sulphonylureas the side effects of hypoglycemia and weight gain have a smaller likelihood.Examples of prandial glucose regulators are (brand names in brackets): Repaglinide (Prandin) Nateglinide (Starlix)."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors?,220,"Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose (marketed as Precose or Glucobay) or miglitol (branded as Glyset) are drugs for type 2 diabetes which slow down the digestion of carbohydrates in the small intestine and therefore can help to reduce after meal blood sugar levels."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are Thiazolidinedione / Glitazones?,221,"Thiazolidinediones also known as glitazones are a medication for type 2 diabetes which help to improve insulin sensitivity and have been found to help decrease triglyceride levels.

Pioglitazone (Actos) has also made the news in connection with instances of bladder cancer however the danger has not been deemed sufficient to need to ban the drug in the UK."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are DPP-4 inhibitors / Gliptins?,222,"DPP-4 inhibitors also known as gliptins are a class of drug which help to stimulate the production of insulin and reduce the production of glucagon particularly during digestion.

This drug class includes following medications (trade names in brackets): Linagliptin (Tradjenta) Saxagliptin (Onglyza) Sitagliptin (Januvia) Vildagliptin (Galvus)."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are Incretin mimetics / GLP-1 analogues?,223,"Incretin mimetics also known as GLP-1 analogues are an injectable treatment for type 2 diabetes. Incretin mimetics look to mimic the effect of a group of hormones called incretins which increase the production of insulin and decrease the release of glucagon in a relatively similar way DPP-4 inhibitors. This is not a coincidence as the way DPP-4 inhibitors work is to prevent the protein dipeptidyl peptidase-4 from destroying the incretin hormones. GLP-1 analogues have been found to be particularly effective in helping to improve blood glucose levels and helping with weight loss. The following GLP-1 analogues are prescribed in the UK (branded names in brackets): Dulaglutide (Trulicity) Exenatide (Byetta) Liraglutide (Victoza) Lixisenatide (Lyxumia)."""
Diabetes Drugs: what are Amylin analogues?,224,"Amylin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and released at the same time as insulin but in much smaller quantities (about 1% compared with insulin).

Medical and sexual past often has an influence as does prescription or illegal drug use. ED patients may be physically examined and bodily features can give clues to the cause. Laboratory tests can also be key for diagnosing ED. Further tests such as monitoring nocturnal erection (nocturnal penile tumescence) can help to cancel some causes out. Furthermore psychological examination can reveal psychological factors."""
Are there treatments for men with diabetes and erectile dysfunction?,228,"Men who have diabetes and are having trouble achieving or maintaining an erection can take oral medicine. The NHS can provide the following medications on prescription for men with diabetes: Brand names include: Viagra, Cialis, Levitra.

Additional treatments include intracavernous injection therapy, vacuum constriction devices, intraurethral therapy and sex therapy. Psychotherapy can have an enormous influence on erectile dysfunction. Further treatment such as surgery and vacuum devices may also have a role to play in some specific cases."
What is prediabetes?,229,Prediabetes is indicated by the presence of blood glucose levels higher than normal but not high enough to be classed as diabetes.
Does stress impact blood sugar levels?,230,"There is an ever-growing amount of scientific literature relating stress and blood glucose levels. When stressed, the parasympathetic nervous system releases a slew of hormones that work to help you get through stressful situations. Evolutionary, this stress response would be the result of immediate danger to your life, thus these hormones work to increase heart rate, increase blood vessel diameter, reduce saliva production, reroute blood from the digestive organs to the muscles (slowing down digestion) and most importantly, convert glycogen to glucose for immediate use. Considering the stressful society we live in it can be asserted that these hormones that should be released to help keep us safe from predators are now actually damaging our health by increasing blood glucose levels when they do not need to be raised. Stress reduction techniques are invaluable for people that have to monitor their blood glucose levels. Simple stress alleviation techniques include regular exercise, listening to calming music or practising yoga/breathing exercises."

Many low carbers, including myself, enjoy refreshing sugar-free drinks like carbonated water with slices of lemon and lime."
Can I come off insulin?,233,"The Low Carb Program is a safe and effective way for people to treat their diabetes. Naturally, when you lower your carbohydrate and sugar intake, your blood glucose levels go down. Thus, your insulin injection doses should also decrease.

Of course, these changes to your medication should be made in collaboration with your GP or diabetes nurse."
How do I eat to my meter?,234,"One of the less appreciated techniques for living with diabetes is eating to your meter. This involves a process of trial and error with different types of foods and eventually results in an in-depth knowledge of your bodies response to certain foods. Using this technique will essentially teach you how specific foods will impact your blood glucose level and to what extent you should be eating them. To use this technique simply find a food item that you want to eat, but are unsure about. After consuming a small amount of said food, proceed to check your blood glucose levels. If theyre within a good range, at a later date eat a slightly larger portion and check again. Repeat this process until you eat an amount that raises your blood glucose higher than you deem acceptable. At this point, you have found the threshold amount of food you can eat without it raising your blood glucose level."
What is fibre and should I avoid it?,235,"Fibre is a type of complex carbohydrate that can’t be digested in the human body. As it can’t be digested, it has no impact on blood sugar levels."
Why are my blood glucose levels high in the morning when I’m fasted?,236,"Firstly, there is nothing to worry about, this is a very common occurrence in people with type 2 and is usually caused by what is known as dawn phenomenon. This occurrence is a result of hormone release during the night. Whilst asleep, our bodies secrete growth hormone and cortisol (two common hormones) which signal to the liver to release glucose. This is to ensure you have enough glucose in the morning and dont wake up with a hypo. However, it is not always certain that dawn phenomenon is the reason for your high blood glucose levels.

For Courgetti, use a spiralizer or peeler to cut the courgette into spaghetti like strips. Then fry for a minute on a pan with olive oil or coconut oil. After a minute add a few tablespoons of water and some salt/ pepper. Cook for another 4 minutes, or until soft. Alternatively, Holland and Barret, Myprotein and a few other health stores sell carb free pastas and spaghetti but as I havent tried any of them I cannot advocate their use. "

What’s the minimum amount of carbs I should eat per day?,401,"Technically, as carbohydrates aren’t an essential nutrient, the minimum carb intake per day is zero. However, this can be quite impractical for most people.

Many of our low carb champions stick to around 40-80g of carbs per day."
Will Low carb help my Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease?,402,"despite being geared towards type 2, as most individuals with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease  (NAFLD) also have insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and an increased type 2 risk, the Low Carb Program is an excellent way to reverse these things.

Will the low carb program work for type 1?,404,"Despite type 1 and type 2 occurring via different mechanisms, both are related to an inability to create, process or use insulin. When this occurs, glucose is no longer efficiently absorbed into cells and stays in the blood stream. Long term, this can be quite damaging. Regardless of your type of diabetes, consuming fewer carbs can be very beneficial, even resulting in a significant decrease in medicine use."
Why haven’t I lost any weight yet?,405,"sometimes, when changing your diet it can take a little while for your body to adjust. The key here is patience. Once your body realises that this is a lifestyle change and not simply a week long diet that will soon be over, you will start shedding more fat. Some factors that may be hindering your weight loss include consuming more carbs than you realise, not exercising frequently and (again) your body adjusting. Another excellent weight loss technique is intermittent fasting. This involves a period of around 16hrs in which you do not eat, followed by an 8hr period within which you consume your food for the day. This fits in perfectly with LCHF dieting as your body becomes adapted to burning fat for energy (of which you have stores) instead of sugar which is limited. Although if youre only just starting the program I’d say to be patient and see where youre at in a few weeks before you start looking to implement Intermittent fasting. "
Will low carb help lower my blood pressure?,406,"One aspect of low carb dieting that is especially helpful for heart health is related to insulins impact on the kidneys, and thus your sodium (salt) levels. In addition to its role in glucose storage, insulin has been shown to increase kidney re-absorption of sodium. When you follow a low carb diet your insulin levels are lowered. This results in the kidneys drastically lowering their rate of re-absorption of sodium and water, leading to lower sodium levels and blood pressure. This makes the Low Carb Program an excellent dietary strategy to combat high blood pressure. For more practical ways to lower your salt intake, look to stay away from highly processed meats like bacon, sausages, cold cuts and frozen breaded meats. Canned and pickled vegetables, canned soup, seasonings and condiments can all be chocked full of salt. Its definitely worth checking the label."
