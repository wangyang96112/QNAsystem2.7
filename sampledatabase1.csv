1,"There are 4 types of insulin based on how soon the insulin starts working (onset) when it works the hardest (peak time) and how long it lasts in your body (duration). However each person responds to insulin in his or her own way.That is why onset peak time and duration are given as ranges. The types of insulin are: Rapid-acting insulin (Lispro) reaches the blood within 15 minutes after injection. It peaks 30 to 90 minutes later and may last as long as 5 hours. Short-acting (regular) insulin usually reaches the blood within 30 minutes after injection. It peaks 2 to 4 hours later and stays in the blood for about 4 to 8 hours. Intermediate acting (NPH and lente) insulins reach the blood 2 to 6 hours after injection. They peak 4 to 14 hours later and stay in the blood for about 14 to 20 hours. Long acting (ultralente) insulin takes 6 to 14 hours to start working. It has no peak or a very small peak 10 to 16 hours after injection. It stays in the blood between 20 and 24 hours.Some insulins come mixed together. For example you can buy regular and NPH insulins already mixed in one bottle. They make it easier to inject two kinds of insulin at the same time.However you can’t adjust the amount of one insulin without also changing how much you get of the other insulin.""",['peak'],"['insulin', 'types', 'insulin', 'body', 'duration']","['types', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'onset', 'time', 'body', 'duration']",there are 4 types of insulin based on how soon the insulin starts working (onset) when it works the hardest (peak time) and how long it lasts in your body (duration).,informationanddefinition,How many types of insulin are there?,['many'],"['types', 'insulin']","['types', 'insulin']"

4,"Alcohol can have a confusing effect on blood sugar levels because it prevents the liver from producing glucose. One consequence of this is that hypoglycemia can occur after a night of drinking. As a result people with diabetes are often advised to eat something to compensate for the expected drop in blood sugar levels. Alcohol does affect different people in different ways so if in doubt test your blood glucose to see how alcohol affects you.

11,"Autoimmune disease refers to illness or disorder that occurs when healthy tissue (cells) get destroyed by the body’s own immune system. The term autoimmune disease is one that many people with diabetes - in particular those with type 1 diabetes - will have come across or be familiar with. In the case of type 1 diabetes the disease-fighting system mistakes healthy cells in the pancreas for foreign harmful invaders and attacks them leaving the body unable to produce its own insulin and keep levels of blood glucose under control. There are more than 80 different types of autoimmune disease from multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes to coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The immune system is the body’s protection against harmful substances such as bacteria viruses and toxins all of which contain harmful antigens. To counter this the immune system produces and sends antibodies (special proteins) to identify destroy these antigens. However in some cases the immune system cannot distinguish between healthy harmless tissue and antigens and as a result it attacks and destroys normal tissue (in people with diabetes the cells mistakenly targeted are the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas). This autoimmune reaction (or ‘attack’) is what triggers the development of an autoimmune disease.""","['autoimmune', 'healthy', 'own', 'immune']","['illness', 'autoimmune disease', 'tissue', 'disorder', 'cells', 'body', 'immune system']","['disease', 'illness', 'disorder', 'tissue', 'cells', 'body', 'system']",autoimmune disease refers to illness or disorder that occurs when healthy tissue (cells) get destroyed by the body’s own immune system.,informationanddefinition,What is an Autoimmune Disease?,['Autoimmune'],['Autoimmune Disease'],['Disease']

In some cases people may eat to amplify the negative feelings. Binge eating may also occur in people trying to lose weight through methods such as greatly restricted calorie content or missing meals which can lead to intense hunger and feeling a need to binge eat.

18,"It is not unusual to experience hunger soon after eating snacks or meals with particularly fast acting carbohydrate content. Typical examples of foods with quickly absorbed carbohydrate include: Sugary foods Potato based foods Refined carbohydrates such as white bread white pasta and white rice When we eat quickly absorbed sources of carbohydrate our blood glucose levels will initially rise rapidly and should trigger our pancreas to release insulin. This usually presents problems for people with diabetes. In type 2 diabetes the body doesn’t respond as well as it should to insulin and so it takes longer for the body to produce sufficient insulin to cope with the rise in blood sugar. People with type 1 diabetes will inject insulin to help the body cope with the increase in blood sugar levels but when we eat fast acting carbohydrate it can take more than 2 hours for enough insulin to be absorbed to adequately cope with the increase in blood glucose levels. When our blood sugar levels rise to high levels and we don’t have sufficient insulin in our blood to cope it can often cause us to feel both tired and hungry and can therefore make us crave more food which can lead to vicious circle forming. Another reason for feeling intense hunger after consuming too much quick acting carbohydrate is that once our insulin has caught up the insulin may bring our blood glucose levels too low which frequently triggers strong feelings of hunger.""",['unusual'],"['snacks', 'hunger', 'meals', 'carbohydrate content']","['hunger', 'snacks', 'meals', 'carbohydrate', 'content']",it is not unusual to experience hunger soon after eating snacks or meals with particularly fast acting carbohydrate content.,informationanddefinition,How can hunger follow after recently eating?,[],['hunger'],['hunger']

Usually a diabetes care team will plan an insulin regimen suited to individual requirements and habits of the child. Fast-acting insulin will generally be administered during the day and nocturnal levels will be controlled by a slow-acting dose. Insulin pumps are also common amongst children. Sometimes in the initial period following diagnosis small children will only need a very small dose of insulin but this will unfortunately change as they grow older and larger.

Gum disease also known as periodontitis is the sixth most common disease in the world. It occurs when bacteria within the mouth begins to form into a sticky plaque which sits on the surface of the tooth. Gum disease is classified on the severity of its development. There are three stages of gum disease: Gingivitis: Gingivitis is the initial stage of gum disease caused by poor oral hygiene and irregular plaque removal from teeth. It is characterised by swollen red and tender gums and it can cause bleeding when brushing. Luckily gingivitis is reversible and through improving your oral hygiene techniques and visiting your dentist or hygienist for advice on a home dental health care program you should be able to reverse this process. Periodontitis (Mild): Untreated gingivitis can lead to mild periodontitis. The conversion of gingivitis to periodontics is more common in people who have a family history of gum disease poor oral hygiene and uncontrolled diabetes. At this stage there will be damage to the gums and bone supporting the teeth. In order to prevent further damage a prompt visit to the dentist is required to prevent further progression. Periodontitis (Severe): This is the most advanced stage of gum disease characterised by significant tissue and bone loss around the teeth. Having prolonged high blood glucose levels can lead to gum disease developing or worsening more quickly but keeping your levels within a normal range reduces the risk of infection spreading. Unfortunately when your body begins to fight an infection blood glucose levels will usually rise in response.

High levels of cortisol can lead to conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome which is one of the lesser known causes of diabetes. Constant stress and frustration caused by long term problems with blood glucose regulation can also wear people down and cause them to neglect their diabetes care. For example they may start to ignore their blood sugar levels or simply forget to check them or they may adopt poor lifestyle habits such as exercising less eating more ‘junk’ and processed foods drinking more alcohol and smoking. This is known as diabetes burnout. While stress alters blood sugar levels the extent of its impact varies from person to person. Studies into the effects of stress on glucose levels in humans have shown that mental or psychological stress causes a rise in glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes and in most type 1 diabetics although levels can drop in some individuals with type 1.

It is possible that this ‘rabbit in headlights’ reaction is similar to playing dead which could have helped our ancestors avoid attacks in the wild.

That means cutting out things like chocolate, cake, ice-cream, and sugary drinks. Also looking to decrease carbohydrate consumption to under 150g per day. That means cutting back on starchy foods like pasta, rice, bread, potato, pastries, cereal and crisps. Look instead to eat fresh vegetables and increase your healthy fat consumption by eating cuts of meat, fish, dairy (excluding milk) seeds, nuts, avocado and olives/olive oil.
